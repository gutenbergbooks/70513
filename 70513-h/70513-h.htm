  <h2 class='c013'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_6 c014'><i>THIS is a story for boys who want to know of the thrills
and joys of Aviation. It is written by a war flyer who
was a pilot with a squadron at the front and who there
learned to know how he and other young men reacted to those dangerous
moments when lightning-quick decisions were necessary.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>He has seen many boys learning to fly, and observed how
most of them, after they had learned, acted in a crisis with the
utmost coolness whether it was the sing of a bullet or the miss
of a motor that brought the warning of danger.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>He knows that those flyers were wrong in their belief during
the war that no flying in peace time could equal the thrill and
tingle of the nervous excitement which they were then experiencing.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>Since the war ended, the design of planes and engines has so
far advanced that distances are being spanned now that they
never then believed possible.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>Nature has put dangers in the paths of our modern flyers,
as great or greater than that of an enemy, for from the moments
of the dangerous take-off with tremendous loads of fuel, until
the landing on another Continent, there can be no relaxation.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>And after watching the planes leave for long ocean flights
where no safe landing can be made for many hours, we have come
to realize and appreciate the strain these pilots are under.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>When several of these bidders for long distance honors have</i>
<i>failed to appear at their announced destination and when, after
a frantic search has been carried on over land and sea, the world
has been forced to admit that no trace—not even a stick of wood
or a rag of fabric—can be found, then it is comforting to think,
to hope, that <b>somewhere</b>, a safe landing has been made.</i></p>

had finished, seemed in no hurry to clear the table.
Darkness had come, and through the windows of their
little houseboat twinkling lights on the shore half a mile
away were reflected in the quiet waters of the bay. All was
still except for the putt-putt of a motor-boat a long way off.
The man in blue trousers and white shirt with the collar
open seemed to be listening for something. The boy tried
hard to get him to talk.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How long will Dad be, do you suppose?” “Will he come
back by train, or will he fly back?” were some of his questions.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack’s reply to them all had been, “We’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The boy thought to himself, “What a silly answer,” but
that seemed to be all the silent sailor man would say. He
looked little enough like a sailor now, and not nearly as
grand and imposing as when he had met the boy and his
father in New York as they stepped off the train on their
arrival from the West nearly a month ago. At that time he
had appeared in his uniform of blue with gold braid and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>gold wings. As they had driven out from the station across
the crowded city with its strange noises and bewildering
lights, there had been time to do little more than notice the
slim straightness of him.</p>

<p class='c015'>His Dad had said to Jack, after the first greetings were
over, “Well, here’s the young fellow I wrote you about. I
couldn’t leave him out West, and besides he will be a great
help around the hangar.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And Jack had replied, as he shook hands, “One more
Kiwi for our camp.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Right,” said Dad, “but I have had to make him a promise
that he won’t be a Kiwi for long.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was a good enough name in its way, and it did seem
to stick to him wherever Dad went. All his boy friends knew
him as Snub but, of course, the boys knew so little about
flying and few of them knew where the name of Kiwi came
from.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad had told him that during the war—and Dad had been
there, so he should know—all of the officers who did not
fly had come to be known as Kiwis, named after a bird from
Australia or New Zealand “which had wings but did not fly.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>So Kiwi he was. There seemed a promise in the name that
one of these days he would learn to fly, for, after all, a Kiwi
<i>did</i> have wings. It was something to start with, and on all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the flights he had gone on with Dad he had kept his eyes
open and now felt that he understood all that had to be done
to control the plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>Often when they had landed after a flight, old war-time
friends of Dad’s would come over with a loud “Well, Skipper,
how’s the boy doing? Going to send him off solo<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c023'><sup>[1]</sup></a> soon?”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After a pupil completes his training with an instructor, who has a
duplicate set of controls, then he is sent on his first solo flight.
To fly solo is to fly alone.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>And Dad would reply, “Not yet awhile. He has a lot to
learn and there’s plenty of time yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So on that first meeting with Jack, as they rolled across
the bridge to Long Island, Kiwi had wondered if this broad-shouldered
sailor-flyer could be coaxed into teaching him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad and Jack had been too busy talking to notice him.
Dad was asking a thousand questions: how much had they
got done on the ship? ... were the tanks installed yet? ...
had the motor been shipped? Dad seemed upset that more
had not been accomplished. “We must get a hustle on if
we’re to get off by the 15th of June,” he had said.</p>

<p class='c015'>After they had been riding for some time, Kiwi asked:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Whose house are we going to, Dad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad turned to Jack, who hurriedly said, “Wait till you
see. I have had a wonderful idea. You remember Old Bert
who used to fly the pontoons over at Rockaway—who
would loop any old crate they would let him fly? He has a
shipyard over here and is building houseboats—two sizes—and
he thought we would like to use one of the smaller ones—just
one big room and a little kitchen and a porch. We can
moor it where we like, sleep under the awning on top, and
keep the car on the shore near by so that we can run back and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>forth to the field. That will only take about twenty minutes,
and it means a good swim in the morning and another after
mucking around the hangars all day. Does the Kiwi swim?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Like a fish.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, that’s settled then.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>A half hour later they swung down a long hill and into
the main street of a little town, nestling in a deep valley,
with a long, lake-like arm of the Sound coming nearly to
the center of the village. They turned off and wound through
a big yard where piles of boards and planks and beams rose up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>like top-heavy buildings along the narrow roads. The smell
of cedar and pine hung in the air. They drew up at the wide-open
door of a shed from which came the whine of buzz-saws
and the pounding of hammers. They had hardly stopped
when a sunburned man appeared at the door, evidently
expecting them.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hello, Bert,” they called.</p>

<p class='c015'>He rushed over to the car, shook hands with Dad, and
there was a great hubbub of questions and answers. He said
their boat was waiting, and it would be a tip-top place to
spend a cool hour or so hearing all the news.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were rowed out, and Kiwi spent busy minutes exploring
the little houseboat. He came into the sitting room in
time to hear Dad say to Bert, “As soon as the backers came
across with the money, I wired Burrows to start work on the
plane as we had planned it and to rush it through so that
we could make our tests and still get off in June while the
weather was good. Then I turned heaven and earth trying
to find Jack. I had no idea whether he was out East with the
fleet or had come back. When I did locate him, he was able
to get leave from the Navy to make the flight, and hopped a
train for Washington and got right to work on weather maps.
He seems to have the navigation part of our trip very thoroughly
in hand. Tomorrow I will get over to the factory and
see if they cannot be hurried with the plane.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And from then on there had been endless conferences with
old friends and new about equipment to be taken, routes to
be followed, wind currents to dodge. The days had stretched
into weeks, and still the plane was on the ground.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had been taken to the factory twice. The plane looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>enormous even in its unfinished state. The body of the
machine still lacked its covering, but in its middle sat an enormous
metal tank. Control wires seemed to run in all directions.
The big wing also carried two tanks, and only the
wing-tips were hollow. The engine was still missing. There
were reports that it had been shipped, but for days after that
it did not put in an appearance.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>Nearly always Jack and Kiwi spent the day on the houseboat
or driving over the winding country roads near by.
Jack pored over maps and strange charts. He brought home
queer instruments and tested them from the roof of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>houseboat during the moonlight nights. They swam, and
once or twice they went fishing.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last the day came when the plane was finished, and must
be taken up for its first test flight. Jack and Dad had talked
it over the day before, and it was decided that Jack and Kiwi
should stay on the boat and let Dad do the testing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll get plenty of chances, Jack, later on, after I get
the feel of it.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>So now Jack and Kiwi sat there on the houseboat after
supper, impatiently waiting for the sound of oars. About
nine o’clock they heard a little boat bump against their
home, and both rushed out.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was Dad.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jack, she flies—she really does! She lifted off the ground
in about two hundred yards and handled like a dream. Of
course, there are some things to be done, but they can be
fixed when we get the plane over at our field. You and I
will go after it tomorrow and start our own work on it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“May I go with you to bring it back, Dad?” Kiwi asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, not this time. You’ll have other chances later on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The day that Dad and Jack went after the plane dragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>endlessly for Kiwi. He had been driven over to the airdrome
early so that he could welcome them when they arrived.
Ordinarily he would have been interested in the other planes
that were busy about the fields. They were continually hopping
off and landing, being fuelled up with gasoline and going
up again. But today it was different. His mind was on Dad
and Jack, and he was constantly on the lookout for their
return.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last, late in the afternoon, the sound of a different motor
drew the attention of the pilots and mechanics to a new plane
coming in from the west. It circled the field several times,
and came down to land at the far end. Wheels and tail skid
gently touched, and the plane rolled along with scarcely a
bump. It taxied up to the hangars and was soon surrounded
by an excited group curious to see all the new features of this
bird which was to attempt such a tremendous hop. For the
word had traveled that here was a new challenger for the
long distance record. Here was a machine, equipped with all
the latest gadgets,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c023'><sup>[2]</sup></a> in which two experienced flyers were
planning to leave New York and not touch their wheels
again till they arrived in far off India.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A term used in referring to the instruments on a plane and the levers
or buttons which control them.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Its single huge wing glistened in the sunlight. The pilot
and navigator’s cockpit, covered with glass, was just in
front of this wing and behind the huge radial engine which
was even then slowly and smoothly turning the propeller.
Just behind the wing in the body of the machine was a tiny
window, through which those who were tall enough could
peek in and see a small compartment behind the gas tank.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The two wheels of the undercarriage<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c023'><sup>[3]</sup></a> bore massive balloon
tires and were further protected by large shock absorbers upon
which the weight of the plane rested. The whole plane was
painted a brilliant orange.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The undercarriage consists of two wheels and a frame-work which are
attached to and support the body of the plane.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Switching off the engine, Dad stepped out with a happy
smile. “So far, so good.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>Then came days of trying and testing. Fortunately they
were favored with splendid weather. For a day or two it
rained during the morning, but they were able to get in one or
two flights before dark.</p>

<p class='c015'>They took the machine up so that Jack could test his wireless.
A Lieut. Connors flew over from Washington with a
small, compact set which he hoped would be better than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the one they already had in the machine. On one of the tests
it seemed as though the ultimate in wireless transmission and
reception had been accomplished for an airplane.</p>

<p class='c015'>The machine went to two thousand feet, the wireless aerial
was lowered, and Kiwi stood beside Lieut. Connors, who was
manipulating the receiving set in the back of a small truck.
Jack and Connors tested their signals both flying away from
and toward the receiving set. The dots and dashes of the
code came in equally strong either way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi put on the head-phones to listen while Connors
clicked out a message to those soaring above. Jack had
taught Kiwi the wireless code for his name, and soon he was
thrilled to hear “H-e-l-l-o K-i-w-i” come down from the air.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, there were other days when the set seemed not
to work so well, and it took hours of tinkering before all
the troubles were found and adjusted. The set in the plane was
finally moved to a place away from the main tank and the
engine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then there was the compass to be corrected. Kiwi had not
realized that correcting a compass was such a long operation,
although Dad had told him that the magnetic compass in an
airplane was a very sensitive instrument. There was much
iron and steel in the motor, and there were many conflicting
forces pulling the magnetic needle from its position toward
the north magnetic pole.</p>

<p class='c015'>To compensate for these forces, small metallic rods had to
be added.</p>

<p class='c015'>So Kiwi followed as the plane was wheeled out onto a
cement circular platform on the ground away from the buildings.
Marked on this circular platform were the north,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>south, east and west points. Pointing the plane due north,
the bits of iron were placed in position in the compass to
counteract the attraction of the motor and other metal parts.
These bits of metal were about the size of the lead in a pencil,
and were of various lengths. After they had been inserted in
holes provided in the base of the compass, they were secured
in place.</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as the needle pointed to the north as it should,
the plane was wheeled around till it pointed east and the
process was repeated until the compass had been corrected
for each direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, they knew that many times a pen-knife or some
such similar object in the pockets of a pilot would serve to
throw the compass off its proper direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>Knowing the particularly delicate nature of compasses, the
Skipper was very cautious about putting too much trust in
them, and insisted that their compass be carefully checked.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>They also had an earth inductor compass, which was more
reliable, but which had to be adjusted by an expert from the
factory.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ride home from the field in the cool of the evening was
usually taken up with long discussions about balanced rudders
and whether they did not need more surface on the elevators.</p>

<p class='c015'>Later on, even the evenings, which Kiwi always looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>forward to, were taken up with test flights. They tried out
their navigation lights and landing by flares.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many evenings Kiwi would go sound asleep in the back of
the car until the voice of Jack awoke him suggesting that
they rush home for their swim and supper.</p>

<p class='c015'>During all this time, coax as he would, Kiwi had not
been taken on his promised ride. Dad had always answered
in that same hateful formula, “We’ll see.” Why were grownups
so fond of those two words? He promised himself never
to use that expression when he was grown up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had made many friends around the field—the men in
greasy overalls who tinkered with the engines, Old Bill who
kept the lunch stand at the end of the field and who had
made his name famous for having packed the sandwiches for
several earlier cross-Atlantic flights. But there was a scarcity
of boys of his own age. There were plenty who were older
and who seemed to be able to convince the instructors on the
field that they could learn to fly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi felt a lack of the proper arguments to use. He was
sure he could fly if they would give him a chance. But as
soon as he brought up the subject, they insisted on talking
down to him as if he were a child.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi felt that it was Old Bill at the lunch wagon who
eventually got him his first ride in the new plane. His father
and Jack had dashed down for a hurried lunch, and Old Bill
said to Kiwi, “Well, how does she handle?” Kiwi had blushed
to the roots of his hair and admitted that he did not know.
Whereupon Old Bill had turned to his Dad and said, “What,
you haven’t taken this boy up yet?” And his father had
answered, “He’ll get his ride—perhaps tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>That night, after considerable pestering, his father gave
him a definite promise that if the next day were fine he’d get
that first ride.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='c021'>A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_6 c014'>IN the morning, as Kiwi and the two men rowed away
from the little houseboat, clouds hung low over the
bay, the wind whipped up tiny whitecaps, and in the
bow of the boat where Kiwi sat he felt the wavelets going
slap-slap as they drew toward the shore. A sand bank showed
yellow against the dark gray of the sky. Jack had received
weather reports during the night from the wireless he had
installed on their floating home and, with a quick look around,
dismissed the threatening appearance of things with a curt,
“This will all clear away by noon, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s spirits rose, for it had begun to look as though his
flight might be postponed again.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the ride over to the field in the car, Jack said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Skipper, do we try out your comic stream-lining
on the wheels today? Not many pilots have any faith in
them. I cannot see myself where they will add much to our
speed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” replied the Skipper, “I’ll admit that they look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>like a pair of tin pants, but if they add even five miles an
hour to the speed of our bus, that amount, spread over seventy
hours, will mean a lot for our chances of arriving in India.
At any rate, we’ll give them a try today if those mechanics
have managed to get them installed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time they drew up in front of the hangar the weather
looked more threatening. There was little activity outside
the long row of hangars that lined the field. Old Bill had
waved from the little window of his restaurant as they passed.
Only one machine was standing on the line, and the mechanics
were half-heartedly turning the propeller over.</p>

<p class='c015'>At their own hangar the two smudgy mechanics were still
busy with the stream-lining. There seemed little chance
that the plane would be ready much before noon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi wandered up the line of hangars to see what other
excitement he could find. He liked to listen to the flying talk
that was practically the only topic of conversation around
the field. He had learned to respect those rather dingy buildings,
some of which were now in a sad state of disrepair.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had served other purposes during the war. Dad
had even pointed out the deserted and dilapidated buildings
that had been used for barracks, where he had eaten and
slept before being sent overseas. He had also pointed out to
Kiwi the building they had used as a kitchen, where he
had washed dishes and peeled potatoes for twelve hours at
a stretch as a punishment for being caught in his bed after
the whistle for reveille had blown.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was little now to make them glamorous—no uniforms
to be seen, no sound of bugles, no high hopes for adventurous
times across the seas. In fact, they seemed to Kiwi a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>bit too spooky even in daylight. He seldom stayed long in
any one of them. Dad had given him the feeling that they
were crowded with the unseen presence of rollicking young
fellows who had once stayed there, who had gone away,
and had never returned. They had learned to fly, had mounted
into the high heavens, had come to know a world apart—a
world of mountainous clouds, with the ground far below
blue-gray in the early morning—a silent kingdom of its own,
its silence sometimes shattered by the rattle of machine-guns
and the bursts of anti-aircraft shells.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just before noon, as the sky seemed to lighten somewhat,
Kiwi noticed their machine being wheeled from the hangar
with its new stream-lining in place.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>He hurried back and was told that they would soon start.
As chocks<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c023'><sup>[4]</sup></a> were put under the wheels, he climbed up into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the cockpit beside his Dad. It was a tiny place with just
enough room for two men, crowded with instruments and
wheels. Even the seat was a gasoline tank. For gasoline was
to be the life of their flight, and every possible ounce had to
be carried when the real hop-off came. During most of the
tests the tanks were only partly filled.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Chocks are triangular blocks of wood placed in front of the two wheels
of the undercarriage to prevent the plane from beginning to roll after
the propeller has been started.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>He watched Dad as he adjusted the levers, and as the
mechanic said, “Switch off! Suck in!” Dad leaned out and
repeated it after him. The mechanic turned the propeller
over several times to get a rich mixture in each cylinder.
Then as the mechanic called out “Contact!” Dad threw over
his switches, and after a couple of false starts the engine
roared into life.</p>

<p class='c015'>For a few moments, as it warmed up, Dad watched the
dial which told the number of revolutions his engine was
making. Then, as he felt that all was ready, he opened wide
the throttle and the whole plane quivered with the roar of
the engine. As soon as his instruments showed him that the
engine was developing its full power, he throttled back and
motioned to Jack to hop in.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Jack started to do so, he said, “We haven’t the wireless
aerial. Connors is splicing on a new piece.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind,” Dad replied, “we won’t need it this time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad’s invitation to Jack meant that there would be no room
in front for Kiwi. But Dad said, “Kiwi, you slip over the
tank and ride in the compartment in the back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was scarcely room for him to squeeze through in the
space between the top of the tank and the under side of the
wing.</p>

<p class='c015'>The chocks were withdrawn, and they went bumping out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>across the field to the far side and turned into the wind.
Then, as the engine opened up, Kiwi felt the tail lift, they
went rolling across the ground and, with a last gentle bump,
were in the air.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>Kiwi looked out to see the ground apparently falling away
from him, and the hangars, houses and fields took on a toy-like
appearance. He was now accustomed to this sensation,
but he would always remember his first flight and how odd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>it had seemed to have the ground slip away from beneath
him in this strange manner. He remembered the queer feeling
he had had when they made their first turn. It seemed as
though they were perfectly stationary, and that the whole
earth had suddenly started to tilt up until it stood on edge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi remembered, too, his first experience in clouds. The
clouds were not very high, and he had motioned to Dad to
go up through them. As they started up they were soon surrounded
by a fog so dense that even the wing-tips faded from
sight. They had flown on for what seemed to him an endless
time, when Dad shook his head, motioned that the clouds
were too thick, and started down.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wires screamed with the vibration, and Kiwi kept a sharp
lookout over the side for the first appearance of the ground.
Surely they must see it soon! Then, with a sudden start, he
looked over his shoulder to find the earth apparently above
him. It took him some seconds to convince himself that this
was really the ground in such an unusual place. There above
him was this uncanny earth, with the trees lining the tiny
roads, half hiding the toy-like houses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad had afterwards explained to him that in trying to get
up through the clouds he had lost all sense of direction;
that when he had shut off his engine and pointed the plane
to what he thought was down, they had fallen sideways
rather than straight down, which accounted for the earth
appearing in this unexpected quarter.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, on this first flight in the new machine, he had
no such experience; for they had taken off in a straight line
and climbed to nearly a thousand feet before any turn was
made. Also, being completely inclosed in his little compartment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>he felt much more secure. He peered out of the windows,
first on one side and then on the other. As they came
back over the field, he looked down to see several figures
rushing about and another plane taking off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad headed out toward the ocean. It was Kiwi’s first view
of the Atlantic, which extended far off toward the misty
horizon, dotted here and there with busy ships going about
their errands. A long trail of smoke marked a big liner heading
for the port of New York. Its decks and life-boats showed
dazzling white against the dark blue of the water.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Dad turned and they headed back toward the field.
Suddenly, almost from nowhere, there appeared to Kiwi a
plane with silver wings and blue body—the plane that he
had noticed taking off a short time before. It came close and
tried to fly level with them. Kiwi, fascinated, watched the
pilot as he waved to them. He continued to wave, and then
pointed to the side of his machine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi noticed then in large white chalked letters the words,
YOUR RIGHT WHEEL GONE.</p>

<p class='c015'>The pilot of this machine seemed unable to catch up with
them and so attract Dad’s and Jack’s attention.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>As they roared along, Kiwi crossed over to the right side,
looked out of his little window, and there hanging down useless
was the stream-lining and no sign of the wheel.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first thought was, “Now Dad will shew them what it
means to be a good pilot.” Then it crossed his mind, “Perhaps
Dad doesn’t know it’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He scrambled up onto the huge tank and wormed his way
toward the front. Jack saw him coming and motioned him
back. The roar of the motor drowned out Kiwi’s voice as he
tried to tell them what had happened. But Jack did finally
understand as Kiwi pointed frantically back toward the other
plane still trying to overtake them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad gave a startled glance toward the plane and read the
message,</p>

<p class='c015'>YOUR RIGHT WHEEL GONE.</p>

<p class='c015'>He motioned to Jack to open his cockpit window and verify
their predicament. There was a nodding of heads, showing
that both understood.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they got back to the field they flew low, while Dad
waved his arm to let those on the ground know that they
were aware of their plight. The news of their mishap had
evidently traveled, for a crowd was gathering and more and
more cars were arriving.</p>

<p class='c015'>They made no attempt to land for they could see that
another plane was about to take-off, and a mechanic was even
then chalking a new message to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>They circled around until this plane drew alongside, and
against its dark background they read a longer message:</p>

<p class='c015'>LAND AT MITCHEL. AMBULANCE THERE. NO CROWDS.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Dad waved his arm to let them know he understood.
Then he drew over toward the other field and circled around
for several minutes, which came to seem like hours. They
could see the activity on the ground as every preparation was
made to take care of the inevitable crash.</p>

<p class='c015'>To land a heavy plane such as theirs on one wheel was a
thing that had been seldom, if ever, tried before. Kiwi had
heard stories of pilots who had landed not knowing one
wheel was off, and he knew that the consequences were often
very serious. Planes turned over so quickly once the axle
caught and dug into the ground. But he also knew that
warned as they had been of the loss of their wheel, there was
a good chance that Dad would pull them through.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>He thought of the hours of work that had been spent on
this machine and of the high hopes they had that it would
carry Dad and Jack thousands of miles across land and water,
and he realized how dashed their hopes would be if there were
irreparable damage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack’s head appeared above the tank. He motioned Kiwi
forward, and then explained to him by gestures how he must
brace himself when the final moments of landing came.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi nodded and felt that here was his chance to show Dad
and Jack that he had the necessary courage. He knew that he
would prove equal to the test.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>As he dropped back into his compartment, he looked down
on the field. A group of men had marked a cross with wide
strips of cloth in the middle of the field, showing the best
place to land. In front of the Operations Office was a little
group of people beside the ambulance, with a red cross on its
side. As he looked farther along, he saw the red and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>polished nickel of a fire truck. Men were hurrying to different
parts of the field with what he knew to be fire-extinguishers.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The stage was set for the try.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they circled around, heading into the wind, he felt Dad
throttle back the engine and the long, slow glide to the field
was started.</p>

<p class='c015'>The spectators on the ground were no more tense than
Kiwi, through the long seconds of this dive to uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c015'>The silence, after the engine had been throttled down, was
broken only by the rush of the wind through the struts. He
braced himself. He felt Dad tip the plane over so that the
left wheel would touch first. As the plane lost momentum,
the other axle dropped, caught in the ground, and with a
terrific crunching of metal they spun around and came to a
stop.</p>

<p class='c015'>He heard cheers and voices and saw Dad’s scared face come
through the trap door in the bottom.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you all right, Kiwi?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad lifted him down with shaking arms, and they were at
once surrounded by a group of people slapping Dad on the
back and telling him what a wonderful job he had done.</p>

<p class='c015'>They looked the precious plane over. Some damage had
been done, but nothing that could not be fixed within a few
days. One of the wing-tips had been slightly torn and
they would need a new propeller.</p>

<p class='c015'>It seemed no time at all until camera men appeared, and
nothing would do but that Dad must pose with Kiwi on his
shoulder and Jack smiling by his side.</p>

<p class='c015'>Within a few minutes planes from the other field began
arriving. The pilots were amazed to find all three unhurt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and were loud in their praise of the marvelous way in which
Dad had made the landing. He stood there, cool and collected,
smoking a cigarette, the color now back in his tanned cheeks,
his wavy chestnut hair very much awry as he took off his
helmet and goggles. There was nothing to show of the tense
strain he had been under except a slightly drawn look about
his gray eyes. He was shorter and less striking in appearance
than Jack, but the crowd of pilots singled him out and gave
him that praise which only one pilot can give to another.</p>

<p class='c015'>They made a fuss over Kiwi, too, and he had the feeling
that he had been weighed and not found wanting—that in
this emergency he had kept his head and done the right thing.</p>

<p class='c015'>For the first time Dad seemed to notice Kiwi’s nondescript
clothes as the photographers were snapping pictures. True,
very little attention had been paid to what he wore. There
had seemed to be so many other more important things to
be looked after. But as they were riding back to their old
hangar, Dad said, “Kiwi, I think tomorrow would be a good
time for you and me to make a trip into town and we will
get you a new outfit. If you <i>will</i> insist upon getting your
pictures in the papers, the folks back home will want to see
you in the sort of clothes a young aviator should wear.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will it be a uniform, Dad, like yours?” Kiwi had asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Absolutely, if that’s what you want,” had been Dad’s
promise.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='c021'>TROUBLE BREWS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_6 c014'>THEY awoke the next morning to find that their adventure
of the day before had made them famous. The
newspapers all told of the fight for life over the flying
fields of Long Island. They told of the real courage of the
two men and the boy when an unforeseen mishap had so
nearly ruined their plane and their chances for a long distance
record.</p>

<p class='c015'>A reporter from one of the newspapers had questioned the
mechanics in charge of the plane, and hinted that one of them
had been careless in reassembling the undercarriage after the
new stream-lining had been put in place. This was most
difficult to prove. Certainly Jack and the Skipper did their
best to decide from an inspection of the wreckage of the
broken axle what the trouble had been.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper had great confidence in the two mechanics,
Cosgrave and Billings, who were looking after the plane, and
felt quite sure of their loyalty. Jack was not so sure. He had
taken a dislike to Cosgrave, and several times had voiced his
distrust to the Skipper.</p>
<div  class='figright id007'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
<img src='images/i037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>Billings</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>About Billings, who was an English engine expert, there
could be no possible doubt. He had been the Skipper’s engine
sergeant in France. There was nothing particularly handsome
about him. He was rugged, square, had large ears and a
shock of black hair hanging in his eyes. He was always
covered with grease, and grit was ground into his hands.
His finger-nails were always outlined in black. He was
bandy-legged, and even in an army uniform he looked anything
but soldier-like.</p>

<p class='c015'>After the war Billings had gone
back to England and had tried to
keep busy, but times were hard and
there was an over-supply of skilled
mechanics. He had drifted over to
America, and had been working for
several years at the factory that had
built the engine for the Skipper’s
plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the factory head had received
the order for a specially built engine
for a particularly long non-stop flight,
he had sent for Billings and told him
that here was an engine that must
be watched through all its construction,
from the tiniest nut and bolt,
to the moment of its great trial.
Nothing must be overlooked. Everything
must be tested and re-tested.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It will make or break our reputation,
for I have every confidence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Captain McBride who is going to make the try,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings’ face lighted up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That wouldn’t be Skipper McBride—er—Captain Malcolm
McBride—would it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, that’s the man. A pilot with plenty of experience
and the habit of being lucky.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, sir, I was with him in France for a year. He’ll do
it, and there’s nobody would like to help him more than me.
Is he here? Could I see him?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, but if you want to write him, here’s his address. He
hasn’t come East yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So in the Skipper’s mail one morning a few days later was a
letter from Billings:</p>

<p class='c025'>“Capt. Malcolm McBride, D.F.C.,</p>
<p class='c026'>Dear Sir:</p>

<p class='c026'>I take my pen in hand to tell you that this is your old
Sergeant Billings of No. 206 Squadron. You will remember
me from the old days in France, especially the time you took
me up for a ride and threw the old Bristol fighter about until
I lost my false teeth, and had to get leave to go back to
London to get a new set fitted.</p>

<p class='c026'>I am working now for the company that is building your
engine, and you can rest assured that I will watch it, Captain,
until it is ready for delivery. What I was wondering was,
wouldn’t you be needing some one to look after it until your
hop-off? I would like nothing better than that job. I think I
could get a leave to help you if you would write to Mr. Block.</p>

<p class='c026'>Hoping this finds you “in the pink” as it leaves me,</p>
<p class='c027'>Yours respectfully,</p>
<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>C. M. Billings</span>. <i>Ex-Sergeant R. A. F.</i>”</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>To say that the Skipper was pleased, is putting it much too
mildly. Of course he remembered Billings. Billings had
been with his squadron during all his flying days in France.
Billings had been the last man he had seen as he left the
ground each day, and the first man to greet him as he landed
and taxied up to an open space in front of the old Squadron
hangars.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Engine all right, sir?” Billings would ask, even before the
Skipper had swung his cramped legs out of the plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings’ personal interest in those engines had been almost
motherly. Once, returning from a trip to the “lines,” the
Skipper had been caught in an almost tropical downpour of
rain, which made it necessary for him to land and spend the
night at an airdrome about thirty miles away from his own.
When he did get back to his own field, Billings had seemed
about to take the whole engine apart just to make sure that
it had not been mistreated while away.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here, surely, was the sort of loyalty that would be needed
in their new adventure. Therefore the Skipper lost no time
in wiring East to make sure that Billings would come with
the engine and help them off to their goal.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of Cosgrave, both Jack and the Skipper knew very little.
He had been recommended by the people who had built the
plane, and had seemed to go about his work willingly and
to do it well. He had apparently obeyed all their orders, and
was ready to help at all times. He had even offered to bring
over a cot and sleep in the hangar so as to “keep an eye on the
plane.” This he had done, and was always there early and late.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack had said to the Skipper one night, “I like Cosgrave
all right, but I can’t say as much for some of his friends.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The Skipper had thought little about this until the accident
with the wheel. Then he began to wonder if Cosgrave were
on the level or if there were something underhanded going on.
The whole thing might bear a little watching. But surely no
one could have any object in stopping their flight. True,
there were others who would like to get the prize money and
the prestige it would bring.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another group of men with a plane almost as good as the
Skipper’s were at a nearby field, and were getting a good deal
of publicity. Every day the papers carried new stories about
their plane. However, the gossip heard around the hangars
told of quarrels and dissensions between the pilots and their
powerful backers. Lawyers had been busy drawing up contracts
and counter-contracts. It seemed hardly possible to
the Skipper that their activities would carry them so far as
definitely to try to interfere with him and Jack.</p>

<p class='c015'>He dismissed the whole thing from his mind, and with his
usual energy began to put the plane into shape with as little
delay as possible. His confidence in his stream-lining idea for
the wheels was unshaken. However, the few minutes they
had been in the air had given them no check on their speed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Repairs of a temporary nature had to be made quickly at
the army field. A new propeller was ordered.</p>

<p class='c015'>During the two days these repairs were going on, Kiwi
had a chance to see and explore this new field. All during the
day army planes fully equipped with guns were taking off
and landing and practising close V formations over the field.
The pilots’ uniforms with their silver wings were a welcome
change from the golf clothes that most of the men at the
other field wore.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>True to his promise, the Skipper took Kiwi into New York,
where they went to a huge store on Madison Avenue and
ordered a tunic and breeches to be made for him. Kiwi
secretly hoped that Dad would buy him some field boots
such as he wore, but Dad seemed to think that leather puttees
would do as well. The salesman in the store had recognized
the pair from their newspaper photographs, and they were
the center of attraction during their stay.</p>

<p class='c015'>The man who took Kiwi’s measure remarked about his
straightness and his sturdy shoulders. He said it would take
a week for the uniform to be finished, and Kiwi could hardly
wait to see it.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, the days passed. The new propeller was fitted.
The plane was flown back to the old hangar and the tests
went on.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was finally established that the Skipper had been right—the
new stream-lining had increased the speed of the plane by
exactly eight miles an hour. There could be no question that
it was an advantage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Through one of Jack’s friends in the Navy, they met a
chemist who was developing a new fuel, lighter in weight
than gasoline and nearly twice as powerful. He was anxious
for them to try it out on their flight to India. Their experiments
with it had led the Skipper and Jack to believe that it
was a real discovery, and they decided to test it out on a long
flight before the big hop.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tanks were nearly filled with the new fuel, and early
one morning they took off for Washington. It was to be their
longest test and would give them a good check on their
speed and fuel consumption.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Kiwi was not to go along, but Bert had promised to take
him on a sailing picnic that day. Several times Kiwi had
seen Bert in his sailboat, with a crowd aboard, sail off up the
bay, and he was torn between the desire to go with Bert and
the feeling that he did not want to miss a day at the flying
field.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad and Jack had been gone about half an hour when Bert
sailed alongside the houseboat and Kiwi hopped aboard.
They spent a glorious day along the sunlit shore of the Sound,
and at noon put in to Mattituck where they built a fire on the
beach and had their lunch. They roasted potatoes, fried some
bacon, and romped with a friendly dog who came to visit
them. The shore was wide and sandy, and about an hour
after lunch they had a swim in the cool waters of the Sound.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the trip back the wind died down, and they lay becalmed
for nearly an hour. Then a light wind sprang up from another
quarter. The sun sank lower in the west. They were still
some miles from home. Bert finally gave up trying to sail,
started the auxiliary engine, and they slowly chugged up
the bay.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was dark as they drew abreast the houseboat and there
were no lights showing. Bert wrote a note and left it for the
Skipper, and carried Kiwi off to his own home for dinner.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The day in the open had made him ravenously hungry,
and the meal, served in the wide, cool dining room facing the
shore, was doubly welcome for its touch of home.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert’s wife, who was waiting as they drew up to the little
dock, had embraced Kiwi with a great squeeze as Bert called
out, “How about some food for that boy?” She had had
only fleeting glimpses of Kiwi since the day of his arrival.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>He had seemed so busy with the men folks. However, she
must have had some experience with small boys, for several
times pies, cakes, and doughnuts had been sent out to him.
He liked her cheery bustling about the dining room. It
called to mind his mother who seemed to be somewhere in
his shadowy past. He had missed her terribly after she had
gone, and tonight, seeing Bert’s wife so busy about the house,
brought it all back to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dinner over, they had gone out on the wide veranda in
time to see a new moon climb up from the hills.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert had telephoned the field, and came back with the
report that Dad’s plane had circled Washington, had wirelessed
that all was well, and had started for Norfolk early in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c015'>The minutes dragged. More calls to the field brought
them little comfort. The plane had been seen over Cape May,
but no wireless call had come from it.</p>

<p class='c015'>About nine-thirty Kiwi was packed off to bed, and as he
lay there he heard Bert at the phone still calling the flying
field.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Tucked into this strange bed in a spare room at the head
of the stairs, he lay thinking about the plane. The cool white
sheets, the chintz curtains at the window, the little knick-knacks
on the dresser were unaccustomed and almost forgotten
niceties. The wind and the sun during the day had made him
drowsy, but he could not sleep for wondering what was happening
to Dad and Jack.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was so calm and peaceful there in the little room. The
light breeze that stirred the window curtains only helped to
emphasize this calm. Still, somewhere out along the coast,
perhaps Dad and Jack were in trouble.</p>

<p class='c015'>He tried to picture some adventure that might have befallen
them. If they had had to land in the water, he remembered
that they had no boat. The collapsible rubber one which they
were to take on their trip across the ocean had not yet arrived.
If they did have to land, he hoped that it might be near some
farmhouse which would give them shelter for the night.</p>

<p class='c015'>As he fell asleep, Bert’s voice came drifting up the stairs,
repeating the words that had just come over the telephone,
“No news.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='c021'>THE PLANE IS CHRISTENED</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_6 c014'>KIWI awoke with a dread feeling that something was
wrong. It was daybreak—light was just beginning to
come in the window. Then he remembered that Dad
and Jack had not come back in the plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hurriedly dressing, he tiptoed down the stairs, opened the
door onto the porch, and without disturbing anyone made
his way down the path. The robins and the grackles were
making a great racket in an old pine tree near a little lake in
Bert’s yard.</p>

<p class='c015'>He followed the shore, hurried on through the lumber
yard, and out to the road. The way to the field was by this
time well known to him and he started off at a fast clip. He
felt that he must get over to the field and get some news of
Dad.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were few people on the road, and he had gone perhaps
half a mile before anyone overtook him. The first car
whizzed by, but another, coming along soon after, pulled
up beside him and the man leaned out and called:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Want a ride, Bub? How far are you going?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was not sure that he ought to get into this stranger’s
car; but the man, dressed in dark clothes, a blue shirt and a
cap with a shiny peak, seemed thoroughly friendly. So he
hopped in. The car started off with a clatter and rattle as
Kiwi said that he was going over to the flying field.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s right on my way,” the man said. “I’m just going
over to take out the 4:59.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>“Are you a flyer?” Kiwi asked.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, not exactly. As a matter of fact I’m a fireman on
the Long Island railroad. But I see lots of these flyers as
my train passes by the field. One of these days I’m going to
get one of them to take me up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ve been up lots of times,” Kiwi replied, proudly.</p>

<p class='c015'>They chattered on, and Kiwi told the man who he was and
how his father was planning a non-stop flight to India.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fireman said, a little incredulously, “Are you going,
too?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had to admit, rather shamefacedly, that he wasn’t—at
least Dad had said he wasn’t—“But I’d like to, and I’ve
heard that India is a very nice place. Dad says they have
elephants there the same as they have in the circus, except
they are everywhere. The people wear turbans and bright-colored
clothes, and even the men wear earrings.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The fireman looked a bit skeptical as to that. He had seen
such things at the movies, but really did not believe they
were true.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they turned the corner into the road that led past the
field, he stopped and let Kiwi out. As Kiwi thanked him
for the ride, he said, “Tell your Dad I’m coming over for a
ride one of these days.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think he’ll take you,” Kiwi answered. “You
have to tease him a lot for rides.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As the car started away, it came over Kiwi that he did not
know where Dad was just then. He might be down, almost
anywhere along the coast.</p>

<p class='c015'>There seemed to be no one at the field. He followed the
road down toward their hangar, clambered through the
fence, and came up through the tall grass at the back.</p>

<p class='c015'>He heard voices inside the hangar and stopped. It might
be Dad. He heard Cosgrave saying something, and then a
strange voice broke in, “But you are going it too fast, old
fellow. They’ll catch on to you. Wait till just before they
hop. That’s time enough.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This sounded funny to Kiwi, and he wondered who could
be talking to Cosgrave in this manner. He hurried around
to the front, opened the little door and went into the empty
hangar, making his way to the room partitioned off at the
back. The wind carried the small front door to with a bang,
and the voices he had heard suddenly ceased. As he opened
the inner door, Cosgrave was just standing up and starting for
it. Kiwi looked at the other man, but it was no one he had
seen before. He was neatly dressed and had a tiny black
mustache.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Cosgrave said, in a strange voice, “Oh, hello, Kiwi.
What are you doing around here so early?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I came over to find out what had happened to Dad.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, he’s all right. We got a message during the night
that he had landed near Trenton. Just some little vibration
trouble with the engine, which they’ll fix up first thing this
morning and probably be back here by noon.”</p>

<p class='c015'>After a long pause the stranger lit a cigarette and said to
Cosgrave, “Well, I’ll be running along. You phone me later,
will you?” And with a backward glance at Kiwi, he walked out.</p>

<p class='c015'>About two o’clock that afternoon the plane returned.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad said the plane had performed wonderfully until after
they left Washington. They had been able to form a good
idea of its speed and its new fuel consumption. They were
flying a compass course over the clouds off Norfolk when a
slight vibration had started in the engine. Since it had not been
bad enough to worry them, they had kept on. However, as
they had continued north, near Cape May, it had grown worse,
and although it was dark when they reached Trenton, they
decided to risk a landing at a strange field rather than strain
the engine-bearers. They tried for some time to locate the
airdrome, and finally concluded that they had better try to
land on a large, flat field some miles out from the town.
With the aid of one of their parachute flares, which they
dropped, they had landed with little difficulty.</p>

<p class='c015'>With flashlights they were able to locate the trouble. Two
bolts, holding the engine to its frame, had become loosened
and the cotter-pins from both were missing.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had attracted the attention of a passing motorist
who took Jack to a telephone, while Dad stayed with the plane.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Jack had tried, without much success, to telephone through to
Bert and to the field, and finally had sent telegrams instead.
They tied the wing-tips of the plane to some fence posts, and
a State policeman offered to watch it till morning. The
policeman also directed them to a place where they spent
the night.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the morning, it was the work of but a few minutes to
put the plane into good shape, and with a parting wave to
the policeman and a few people who had gathered to see them
take-off, they left. Without further difficulty they had landed
at their own field.</p>

<p class='c015'>This long test had reassured the Skipper and Jack on many
points, and there seemed little more to do to the plane. The
letters and the numbers of their license, NX-953, had been
painted on the top of the right-hand and on the bottom of
the left-hand wing and on the tail. The man who had done
this had asked about a name, but Jack and the Skipper had
been unable to agree on one.</p>

<p class='c015'>The backers of the flight, having had word that the plane
was nearly ready for the take-off, wrote the Skipper that they
would be at the field by the end of the week. One of them
suggested in the letter that there should be a formal christening.
It would help the publicity. The fact that he had a very
attractive daughter who photographed well may have put
the idea into his head.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s excitement ran high at all these new preparations.
His new uniform had been delivered, and he had strutted
about the houseboat with it on. Both Dad and Jack were
immensely pleased at his new appearance, and Jack promised
to go with him to the barber for a last trimming up.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The makers of Kiwi’s uniform had added a touch of their
own, and had sewed on a small pair of embroidered wings.
But on this point Dad was firm. The wings could not be
worn. “For,” he said, “you are not a pilot, Kiwi, and until
you have learned to fly, no wings.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This started Kiwi off anew on his demands to be taught to
fly. He had worked on Jack on every possible occasion to
get a promise of instruction from him. But so far no definite
promise had been made. Jack, at odd times, had been teaching
him the wireless code. By now Kiwi knew it by heart, and
every evening, when possible, Jack would get him to learn
the sing of the letters. Tacked over Kiwi’s bed was this card
with the dots and the dashes and the letters they stood for:</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>On Saturday afternoon, the party arrived with the attractive
daughter, her mother, and a bottle of what they hoped
was pre-war champagne. The field was crowded. A small
platform had been built and the machine wheeled up to it so
that the attractive daughter could just reach the big propeller.
Both Billings and Cosgrave had spent the whole morning
cleaning and polishing the plane until it shone. Jack, the
Skipper and Kiwi were all in their uniforms. As they stood
on the little platform in the bright sun, to the tune of
clicking movie cameras, the bottle of champagne was brought
down smartly on the metal propeller, and the young girl
said, in a clear voice:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I christen thee ‘Dauntless’, and wish thee all the luck in
the world for thy big adventure.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The crowd cheered, and the golden liquid foamed and
bubbled as it ran down the long blade of the propeller.
Everyone was happy. Any doubt of their success seemed out
of place on this bright, sunny afternoon. Dad and Jack’s confidence
in their machine and in themselves radiated from them.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='c021'>READY TO HOP</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_6 c014'>THE christening was over, and the publicity that it
brought had added interest to their flight. In the
days before the christening they had scarcely ever
been bothered by crowds around the hangar.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now things were changed. Whenever the plane was inside
the hangar, the doors had to be kept closed, or ropes stretched,
to keep the idle curious from interfering with the work in
hand. Rumors were continually being broadcast that a surprise
take-off was imminent, which brought throngs to the
field at all hours of the day and night.</p>

<p class='c015'>Reporters on special assignments were always bothering
the Skipper and Jack with questions about the performance
of the plane, how long they expected it would take them to
get to India, and about incidents in their lives that the reporters
thought would be of interest to the public.</p>

<p class='c015'>From one source or another they found out about the
Skipper’s war record—how he had gone to a ground school
in this country, had been sent to England to finish his flying
training, and, this completed, had waited in England for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>weeks for an assignment to an American Squadron; how the
shortage of planes on the American front had prevented this;
how the British, who had spent time and money in training
American pilots, found themselves with plenty of planes and
a scant supply of their own men to fly them; how the British
government had finally asked and received permission from
the American authorities to send some of these American
pilots to France to work with the British flying corps; how
the Skipper had gone out under this arrangement and fought
with great distinction with his British comrades.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The newspaper men had also looked up stories about the
Skipper that had been printed in his home papers during the
war. These they reprinted—stories of the miraculous way in
which he had come through months of hard flying with
scarcely a scratch; of his spending a couple of weeks at one
of the base hospitals in France, recovering from a slight
wound made by a machine-gun bullet as he was diving on a
balloon near Armentieres, and then, without waiting for the
usual sick leave, of his hurrying back to his squadron and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>plunging once more into the daily round of patrols, shooting
down two enemy planes the very day of his return.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>During one fight, when he was within a hair’s breadth of
adding one more enemy machine to his score, his engine had
stopped in the midst of a zoom, and the enemy, realizing he
was getting the worst of it, had streaked for home, leaving
the Skipper several miles behind the enemy lines with just
enough altitude to glide down to No Man’s Land, where he
had scrambled from his machine into a shell hole. There he
crouched while the enemy artillery battered his plane to
pieces with shell fire. Getting his direction, in the failing
light, from the line of enemy balloons, he had made his way,
as soon as darkness came, to his own lines.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Stumbling across the torn and broken country, he had come
across a British Tommy badly wounded, and had dragged him
to safety. For this and other of his exploits he had been
awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of the highest
British decorations given to airmen.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then, when the Skipper’s leave to England had come
around, after six months at the front, he, with several others,
had been summoned to Buckingham Palace to be decorated
by the King. He had nervously awaited his turn at the end
of a long red carpet which led to the platform where the
King stood. He had walked forward and saluted, more
frightened than he had ever been in the midst of a scrap in
the air. The King had pinned on the cross, had asked him
one or two questions about his flying, had thanked him for
his splendid services as an American with the British army,
and before he knew it the interview was over and he was on
his way out.</p>
<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i056.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>DISTINGUISHED<br />FLYING CROSS</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c022'>The newspapers printed all this,
and drew on their imagination for a
great deal more.</p>

<p class='c015'>They gave a full description of
Jack’s training and work with the
Navy and his flying ability. But
most of all, they devoted many paragraphs
to his development of a device
which was a really practical drift
indicator. This ingenious instrument,
upon which they were going to rely
during their long hop, seemed to
solve the problem of correcting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>drift, even in clouds and fog. Heretofore, pilots attempting to
navigate over long distances of fog-obscured areas had found
themselves unable to tell whether or not the wind was carrying
them sideways off their course.</p>

<p class='c015'>The story of Kiwi’s life and his adventures also became
public property.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings was not much help to reporters. Naturally taciturn,
he became even more so with newspaper men, and was
almost surly in his refusal to help them out with their stories.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cosgrave, however, liked the chance to talk, and did so
on every occasion. The Skipper finally warned him he had
better say little or nothing at all, and that if there were any
information the papers should have, he, the Skipper, would
give it.</p>

<p class='c015'>One evening the Skipper had taken Billings back to the
houseboat with him, and during supper he tried to draw him
out about Cosgrave and what he, Billings, thought of him.</p>

<p class='c015'>During the conversation, Kiwi suddenly remembered the
things he had overheard, on the morning that Dad and Jack
were at Trenton, in the back room of the hangar. He told
Dad about it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad frowned, and for several minutes seemed deep in
thought. Then he said, “Billings, I don’t want to be unfair
to Cosgrave—he may be all right. We have very little proof
that he isn’t. But I am going to ask you to keep an eye on
him. Watch his work on the plane, and if you see the slightest
thing that looks suspicious, I want you to come and tell
me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings had promised to do this, and the Skipper tried to
dismiss from his mind the thought that there might be forces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>working against them other than the natural ones which they
expected to have to contend with.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper and Jack pushed ahead with their preparations.
Their collapsible boat was delivered and they tested
it. When folded, it took up very little room. Attached to
it was a metal cylinder containing compressed air, and it was
the work of a moment to open the valve in this cylinder and
inflate the boat. With it were two tiny oars and a water-tight
pocket in which could be packed medical supplies and
condensed food.</p>

<p class='c015'>They inflated the boat, and Dad and Jack and Kiwi navigated
their strange craft about the harbor, returning to the
houseboat all too soon to please the boy who enjoyed this
novel way of traveling.</p>

<p class='c015'>The time before the hop-off was getting short, and there
was still one detail that gave them considerable concern.
They could not seem to prevent the vibration of the engine
from interfering with the proper functioning of their instruments.
It was annoying to have one or the other of their
dials go wrong.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack finally decided to remove the whole thing, and regroup
the instruments so that all those which had to do with
navigation would be in one part of the board and the engine
instruments in another. The compasses, the drift-indicator,
the dial which registered their turn and climb were placed
on one side, and in front of the Skipper were the oil-pressure,
engine temperature, tachometer or engine revolution counter,
the fuel gauges and the dial which showed their altitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>The entire instrument board had to be protected in some
way from the vibration, and it was Billings’ scheme to set it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>on four rubber blocks which he cut from ordinary rubber
bath sponges.</p>

<p class='c015'>All this took hours of Billings’ time, for each instrument
had to be disconnected and replaced. However, late one
night it was finished, and the Skipper decided that, inasmuch
as the time was getting very short, they would test it at once.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the plane was rolled out of the hangar, the news spread
that they were about to go, and the crowds gathered. Their
announcement that it was only a test flight was not believed.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they were ready to leave the ground they found the
field covered with people, and try as they would they could
find no open space long enough to make the take-off safe. It
was a warm summer night, and apparently everyone for miles
around had driven to the field. The Skipper and Jack eventually
had to abandon the night test and wait until morning.</p>

<p class='c015'>A plan had been forming for some time in Kiwi’s mind.
He had a queer sinking sensation every time he thought of
Dad and Jack going off without him. He saw no reason why
he, too, should not go when the plane left.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The stories he had heard of India made him want to land
there, too. He liked to think of the warm, tropical days and
nights in that strange country. Bert had brought him a book
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of stories about India which had thrilled him. These stories
told of hunting wild animals from the backs of enormous
elephants. He liked to imagine himself seated in one of the
howdahs—the canopied, chairlike saddle strapped to the
back of a richly decorated elephant.</p>

<p class='c015'>He remembered one story of a playful elephant, said to be
over a hundred years old, who pretended to be thoroughly
frightened every time he crossed a stream of water for fear
quicksands would suck him down.</p>

<p class='c015'>He would picture himself wandering through the narrow
streets of the cities, with vistas of temples ahead—their
domes shining in the sunlight, covered with layers of pure
gold that had been added to them through the centuries,
until, on some of the oldest temples, the gold leaf was a
quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had asked Dad a number of times to take him along,
but Dad had always dismissed his request as being out of the
question. However, in the darkness and confusion of that
night attempt, Kiwi thought he saw how it could be accomplished.
He was sure that if there were as much confusion at
the actual take-off, it would be a simple matter for him, in
the darkness, to crawl under the plane, open the trapdoor in
the rear compartment, and slip in unobserved.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi realized that Dad would be upset about his disobedience,
but he felt sure that he could make himself useful
on the trip, and that both Dad and Jack would be glad he
had come.</p>

<p class='c015'>The more he thought about it, the more he knew he couldn’t
bear to be left behind, and the more determined he was to go
with them. During the next two or three days, as Dad and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Jack were making the final test flights, he worked out in his
mind all the necessary details.</p>

<p class='c015'>Weather reports were taking up more and more of Jack’s
time, but Kiwi kept up with his wireless practice. He could
now send twelve words a minute and receive almost ten.</p>

<p class='c015'>About eleven o’clock one night, as Jack got his weather
reports and checked them up from his chart, he called the
Skipper over and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Things look as favorable now as they have for some time.
There is a storm near Chicago moving this way, but I don’t
think it can possibly arrive until about eight in the morning.
There is another one directly in our path in about the middle of
the Atlantic; but from the reports I have it is moving northward
and should be well out of our way by the time we get
there. If you say the word, I’m for starting in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper replied, “The plane is ready. The weather is
up to you, Jack. Let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Telephone calls were put through to the field and to the
official who was to seal the barograph<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c023'><sup>[5]</sup></a> before they started.
They sent word to Old Bill at the lunch wagon to pack the
food and to get the thermos bottles filled.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c024'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Barograph—An instrument which records on a chart the variations in

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>About twelve-thirty, when everything was packed and
ready and they were about to start for the field, they got
another report from the weather man. In the two hours that
had elapsed since the previous report, conditions had changed
for the worse. The mid-ocean storm which they had known
about, had altered its course and was heading in toward
Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Jack and the Skipper talked it over and decided they had
better put off the attempt until there was a better chance of
having favorable conditions. This meant more telephone
calls to tell of their change in plans.</p>

<p class='c015'>When they talked to Billings on the phone, he said that
the field was already covered with people and cars, and that
it was more than likely the crowd would refuse to believe
the take-off had been postponed. He said the plane was in
perfect condition, and that he believed
he would stay at the hangar the rest
of the night.</p>
<div  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i062.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>The Skipper</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>It was a great disappointment to
Kiwi, for his excitement had risen to
fever pitch. However, he was packed
off to bed, and for the next few days
all their plans waited on favorable news
from the weather man. Conditions over
Long Island seemed perfect for the take-off.
The moon was just approaching the
full.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi, for the first time, realized how
many others were helping in this tremendous
undertaking. Wireless operators
on many ships plunging across the
ocean were flashing their news of conditions
as they found them at sea. Other
wireless operators in lonely places were
sending their data of wind velocities,
rain and sleet. All this information was
being gathered and carefully analyzed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>for these two men who would soon come to know the vagaries
of nature at first hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was already in bed and asleep one night when an unusual
bustle about the houseboat awoke him, and he sensed
that something was up. Word had come through that the
path was open for the great dash across the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c015'>Preparations to start were again made, with innumerable
last things to be thought of. Kiwi was able to pack a tiny
lunch and stuff it into his pocket unobserved.</p>
<div  class='figright id008'>
<img src='images/i063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>Jack</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>They were rowing ashore to pick up
Bert when Dad said to Kiwi:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, boy, after we leave, you will
be taking your orders from Bert. Everything
is taken care of, and he will look
after you until we come back. See that
you always do what you know I would
want you to do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi smiled, sheepishly, but could
think of nothing to say.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ride over to the field seemed to
take hours. Neither Dad nor Jack
talked much, but Bert managed to say
to Kiwi:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, they will soon be off, and
then you and I will sit and wait for
news of their arrival.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As they drove onto the field they
saw cars parked everywhere, and
crowds thick about the entrance to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>building. They pushed through them, and there in the lighted
hangar stood the great bird ready for its flight.</p>

<p class='c015'>It had been planned to start from the long runway on the
adjoining field, and the greater part of their load of fuel had
been stored there in readiness. Before the hangar doors were
opened, all their kit had been stowed in the plane, even Kiwi
finding an opportunity to hide away his little package of
lunch in the rear compartment.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last the hangar doors were opened, and ropes having
been stretched to keep the crowd back, the plane was rolled
out, its tail lashed to the rear of a truck and, followed by the
crowd, it began its mile-and-a-half journey to the other field
across the rolling ground. Its mighty wing bobbed and
rocked about as if anxious to be off and away.</p>

<p class='c015'>The moon was partly hidden by a thin layer of clouds so
that the night seemed unusually dark. There was practically
no wind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arriving at the far end of the runway on the other field,
the tail of the plane was set on the ground, and flood lights
were temporarily placed which threw a ghostly glow over
the “Dauntless.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cosgrave and Billings started at once to pump in the precious
supply of fuel. Jack went back to the hangar to get the
last minute weather reports, while the Skipper, easily the
coolest person in the crowd, chatted with the backers of his
flight.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the hours passed the crowd grew, but this time they
were being held back behind lines by the police.</p>

<p class='c015'>Old Bill from the restaurant came puffing up with the
thermos bottles and sandwiches, and with a sly wink to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Kiwi handed him a couple of oranges, saying, “You may
need these, Kiwi.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi became more and more confused. He began to wonder
if it were going to be as easy as he had thought to stow
away when the plane left. He had not counted on those
blinding lights. But he stuck close to Dad and hoped for
the best.</p>

<p class='c015'>About four o’clock the tanks were filled. Fifteen spare
cans, holding four gallons each, had been stowed in the rear
compartment and lashed tight. The barograph was put
aboard and sealed by the official from Washington.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings, in a fever of excitement, decided they’d better
give the engine one more try; so the canvas tarpaulin over
the engine and propeller was removed and the engine roared
into life. Billings ran it long enough to satisfy himself that
it was working perfectly, then turned it off.</p>

<p class='c015'>The heavy silence that fell was almost oppressive. A
meadow lark sprang into the air, with the exultant little
song they sing at dawn. Everyone was tense with the thought
of the great test that was soon to come.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack came back from the hangar with the report that conditions
were as favorable as they had been at any time.</p>

<p class='c015'>They waited for the daylight.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was the sound of a motor overhead, and a plane with
a news photographer aboard swept over them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still the darkness lingered.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sun by now should have been lighting up the eastern
horizon. Instead, came a patter of raindrops, and Billings
rushed to cover up his precious engine and propeller to protect
them from the dampness.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>It rained harder. Many of the crowd, seeing the engine
covered up, decided that the flight was off for that day.</p>

<p class='c015'>A little group stood under the protecting wing of the plane
and waited to see how bad the storm would be.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad turned to Kiwi. “Kiwi, you had better look up Bert
and go back to the hangar with him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s face fell. Plainly disappointed, he nodded his head
and disappeared into the darkness toward the place where
Bert’s car had been parked.</p>

<p class='c015'>The crowd thinned with the usual remark that this was
another false alarm.</p>

<p class='c015'>As suddenly as it had started, the rain stopped.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack, who had expected these local showers, said he thought
it would clear up soon. Not long after, a faint, gray light
appeared in the east, telling of the approach of a new day.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper was impatient to get away. He told Billings
to take the cover off the engine, and he and Jack made a last
examination of the whole plane. They looked at the shock absorbers,
noting that with the heavy load there was very
little play left in them. The Skipper said, however, that
there was enough.</p>

<p class='c015'>By this time Billings was ready to start the motor. Before
the eyes of the small group who had waited through the
rain, Jack and the Skipper got into their flying suits.</p>

<p class='c015'>The big moment had come.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the excitement of the last minute preparations Kiwi had
been missed, and although Dad asked several of the men about
the plane if he had been seen, there were conflicting rumors.
Some thought he had gone back to the hangars; others were
not sure but that he had found shelter in one of the cars.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
<img src='images/i067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Precious minutes were passing. The Skipper felt that the
time had come to go and that saying good-bye to Kiwi would
be too much of an ordeal for him. So he turned to Bert and
said huskily:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Say ‘good-bye’ to Kiwi for me. I am trusting you to take
good care of him. As far as I can see, everything has been
provided for, and I know he will be safe in your hands.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Fearing to trust himself to say more, he hurriedly shook
hands with his close friends, gripped Billings’ hand hard and
slapped him on the back. Then he climbed up into the cockpit,
where Jack was already waiting, and the motor was
started.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the engine was warming up, the crowd could see through
the glass window the Skipper laughing nervously at some
remark of Jack’s. Then he opened the throttle and the huge
engine made a tremendous uproar as he gave it a final try.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings stood at one side, his practised ear listening for
the slightest skip in its measured beat.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper throttled back the engine, leaned out of the
window, and motioned for Billings. As he came up, the
Skipper said, “How does it sound? All right?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings, who had listened to many engines in his day, who
had seen many men trusting their lives to them, and who had
heard that same question asked many times before, felt a
lump rise in his throat as he realized the tremendous responsibility
that rested upon him and upon his answer. He gulped
hard, and then choked out, “All right, Captain—and the
best of luck to you,” waved to Jack, and motioned to Cosgrave
to pull out the chock from under the wheel on his side.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings and Cosgrave stepped back, and for a few moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that were awful in their suspense they waited for the flight
to begin.</p>

<p class='c015'>The engine opened up gradually, took hold, and the plane
slowly started to roll along—the slow roll which was to start
the Skipper and Jack off on an epoch-making flight that would
carry them across the wide Atlantic, over the Mediterranean,
and on to India. The engine had started, and for seventy
hours it would have to keep up an uninterrupted flow of power.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane gathered speed, rocking gently as the tail left
the ground.</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings and Cosgrave had leaped onto the running-board
of a fast car and were speeding after it, watching it gather
momentum for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c015'>Camera men took hurried pictures and scampered out of
the path of the approaching plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>The end of the runway was getting perilously near when
the first sign of lift came. The Skipper was evidently coaxing
her into the air, and the first lift was a bit too soon, for she
settled back to the ground for a moment, seemed to gather
new energy, and then rose surely from the field just as they
reached the brink of a little ravine.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>They were off!</p>

<p class='c015'>In the early morning light the plane was hard to follow.
It could faintly be seen lifting its way upward.</p>

<p class='c015'>Other planes, now that the “Dauntless” was up, soared
alongside the big ship as it carefully made a turn and headed
for the east and the rising sun. The entire group came back
over the field at an altitude of about a thousand feet.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The crowd hoped that there would be a last fluttering
good-bye from the cockpit, but both men were too busy to
do more than glance out.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The flight was on!</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings and Cosgrave returned to the old hangar. Its vast
emptiness oppressed them so that they could hardly speak.
They would have to wait hours and hours to know what all
their work would accomplish. They looked forward to the
long wait with dread.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bert came up in a car and asked if they had seen Kiwi.
Surely by now he would have returned to the hangar. But
no one had seen him since the rain storm that had seemed,
for a time, to blot out the Skipper’s chances for a take-off.
Bert hurried back to the other field with the hope that he
might still be there.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>In the small room at the back of the hangar, Connors
was busy with his wireless set. With the earphones on
he bent over his instruments at the table and tried to pick
up the first message to come back from the plane. From time
to time the click of his sending key could be heard through
the partition.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Both Billings and Cosgrave were absentmindedly picking
up the scattered evidences of the hurried departure from the
hangar. They had closed the big doors, when Billings, very
tense, suddenly swung around and confronted Cosgrave.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cosgrave, you and me have been working hard on this
job for a long time now, and there have been times when I
thought you were up to some crooked business. The plane is
off and away. If anything happens to those boys that I can
trace to you, I’m going to make you the sorriest man that
ever walked onto this field.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cosgrave turned a bright red at all this, but said nothing
for a few minutes, while Billings glowered at him. Then,
seeming to come to a decision, he said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Limey, I think I can trust you. I don’t want you
to mention this to no one, but when I have told you I think
you will understand.</p>

<p class='c015'>“At the beginning I was offered money—and a lot of it—to
try and stop, or postpone, this flight. I was in a jam and
needed money, and I thought I could do something—nothing
serious, you understand—that would look accidental. But
the longer I worked for those two men, the more I realized
that I couldn’t go through with it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then when the Kiwi started flying with them and came
so close to getting cracked up the time they lost the wheel,
I phoned the people who were trying to buy me and said,
‘Nothing doing.’ And Billings, you can believe me or not,
but since that time I have worked even harder than you to
make this flight a success. There is nothing about that plane
now, as far as I know, that isn’t in perfect condition.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Billings felt his anger rise during Cosgrave’s confession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and for a little time he could think of nothing but punishing
the man. With his jaw set hard, he looked straight into
Cosgrave’s eyes, trying to see through to his very soul, to
discover if all he had confessed was the truth. Cosgrave’s
gaze never wavered, and Billings at last decided that Cosgrave
had done no harm and all was right with the plane.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='c021'>THE FLIGHT IS ON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c014'>TO the two men in the cockpit of the monoplane, the
tense drama of hours had been packed into those few
seconds of the take-off.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the Skipper very carefully opened the throttle, the engine
took hold and the plane gathered headway. The soggy
condition of the field after the rain seemed to hold them back.
They could feel the wheels of the undercarriage sinking deep
into the sod and the mud. Jack was conscious for a fleeting
second of the lights of parked cars reflected in numberless
puddles along the course.</p>

<p class='c015'>The roar of the engine increased. They rolled faster and
faster. The Skipper sat tense watching his instruments, with
an occasional quick glance ahead.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were rolling still faster now, gathering speed, and
from the corner of his eye Jack saw the Skipper push the control
stick forward to get the tail off the ground. Striking
uneven spots in the field, the big plane rocked gently. Still
it seemed to drag. But always their speed increased over the
ground.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>They were half way down the field, with still not enough
momentum to lift their heavy load from the earth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Three-quarters of the way down the field, and no tendency
to spring away from the rain-soaked ground!</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack glanced quickly at the Skipper’s face to see if all was
well.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper was looking straight ahead in a fascinated
manner as the end of the runway approached, and the shallow
gulley that lay beyond. Too late now to shut down the
engine and make another try. The next second would decide.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper pulled gently on the stick, the plane lifted
ever so slightly, cleared the ground, dropped back again for
one last little bounce—and then it was almost as if the intense
concentration of those two men helped to lift that tremendous
load into the air and hold it there.</p>

<p class='c015'>They whizzed off the end of the runway and soared just
above the shallow gulley which had been the grave-yard of
an earlier attempt.</p>

<p class='c015'>Once in the air, the plane gained altitude very slowly. Just
ahead was the line of hangars, one of which had housed it
for so many weeks. The Skipper turned the plane slightly so
that they might pass between the hangars and a line of trees.
The red obstacle light on top of the highest hangar was
methodically flashing its warning. They cleared it safely by
several feet and continued their climb.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time they had gone a mile farther, they had height
enough to make a gradual turn and head into the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they came back over the field, escort planes came alongside,
and in one of them a news-reel photographer was steadily
grinding the crank of his machine, getting a record of their start.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The sun rose from behind a heavy bank of clouds and
touched them, lighting up the orange wings till they seemed
a blazing flame. The land beneath still lay wrapt in a blue
haze. To their right a larger bank of threatening clouds was
even then sprinkling its waters into the distant ocean.</p>

<p class='c015'>The escorting planes came closer, looking tiny and unsupported,
their whirling propellers perfectly visible against the
blue-gray background.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time the “Dauntless” had reached the end of Long
Island, all of them had turned back save one, and there its
pilot, with his hands high in the air, sent them a last handshake
and a wave, banked his machine sharply and left them.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was like the last wave from a ship’s pilot as he sends the
vessel off to sea alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>By this time they had fifteen hundred feet altitude and were
beginning to breathe easier. Jack leaned over to the Skipper
and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’re off! How does it feel?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper smiled and replied:</p>

<p class='c015'>“She handles pretty well, but it did seem ungodly tail-heavy
at the take-off. The sooner we can get those small
cans in the rear compartment emptied, the better I’ll like it.
We’d better not try it yet, but as soon as we use some fuel out
of the main tank we’ll empty a few of those spare cans and
heave them overboard.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Setting their course across Long Island Sound, they could
see ahead the dim line of the Connecticut shore, and Jack
lowered their wireless aerial and clicked his first message to
Connors. It was short and to the point.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everything going well. (signed) DAUNTLESS”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>About seven o’clock they were over Cape Cod and could
see many boats and steamers crawling over a smooth sea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack sent another message to Connors reporting all well,
then clicked off in code:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Signing off to empty fuel from spare cans.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper nodded as Jack explained that he would now
attempt the replenishing of the main tank. He carefully
climbed from his seat next the Skipper, and had only just
started to squeeze up into the space between the top wing
and the tank when he stopped with a start. Peering at him
over the top of the tank was Kiwi, with a self-conscious
smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper partly turned to see why Jack had dropped
back into his seat. Jack clutched the Skipper’s shoulder,
leaned over and shouted:</p>

<p class='c015'>“<i>Cripes!</i> The Kiwi’s with us!”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a few seconds none of the three moved. The Skipper
was plainly unbelieving. He thought that Jack must be
dreaming. Coming out of his trance, Jack motioned to Kiwi
to come forward.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi wiggled his way over the tank, still wondering how
he would be received. He shyly put one hand forward and
grasped Dad’s shoulder with as hard a squeeze as he could
muster.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad realized then that Kiwi’s presence was an actual fact.
Here was a stowaway, another life that must be reckoned with
in this adventure. He would have preferred not having this
additional responsibility. There had been enough details to
think about. But there was nothing that could be done, and
his plans must be adjusted to cover this new situation.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
<img src='images/i078.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Kiwi could only say in a shy voice, “I can help, Dad. And
I didn’t want you to go without me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack slipped back into his seat, put on his earphones, and
sent out Connors’ call letter. As soon as he got an answer,
he clicked off a message that the Kiwi was aboard, a stowaway,
and that he would be put on the usual bread and water
diet of all stowaways and made to work.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper then said to Jack, “Here’s your helper for the
gas.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And to Kiwi he said, “Well, boy, you’re in for a long ride
this time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi went to work with a will—unlashed the cans, unscrewed
the tops, and passed them over to Jack who, standing
on his seat, poured the fuel into the main tank. They disposed
of five of them. As Jack opened the sliding panel of
glass beside him, a terrific stream of air blew into the cockpit,
and he hurled each can in turn as far out and down as
he could, so that they would not be carried back into the
tail. Kiwi looked out of his little side-window to see them
tumbling into space, turning over and over, the light glinting
on them as they fell.</p>

<p class='c015'>Beneath them the wind must have been freshening, for
there were signs of whitecaps on the level floor of the ocean.
Dimly to the left could be seen the shore line.</p>

<p class='c015'>Shortly after eleven o’clock, Jack picked up signals from
the <i>S. S. Mauretania</i>. She was notifying the shore stations
that she believed she had sighted the “Dauntless” a short
time before.</p>

<p class='c015'>A little later they were passing over land, which Jack said
was the shore line of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Kiwi commenced to feel hungry, and busied himself peeling
one of Old Bill’s oranges, most of which he passed over to
Dad and Jack.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack took over the controls and flew the plane a couple of
hours while the Skipper stretched himself and carried on a
halting conversation with Kiwi.</p>

<p class='c015'>He learned how, when he had sent him to find Bert, Kiwi
had made a hesitating search, had circled back to the plane,
and, without being seen, had climbed into his place in the
rear compartment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad tried to look stern, but Kiwi could feel that already
he had been forgiven.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane hummed along, and they felt almost as though
they were on a picnic.</p>

<p class='c015'>About twelve-thirty they passed Halifax, and Jack wirelessed
that all was well.</p>

<p class='c015'>Soon they passed over some broken clouds and found the
air very bumpy. They were picked up and carried sometimes
fifty feet before being dropped. Jack had his latest weather
map tacked to a small board in front of him, and he remarked
that they might expect this sort of weather, or worse, before
they reached Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='c015'>They noticed a slight haze coming up before them, and for
the next hour they ran through intermittent showers.</p>

<p class='c015'>Giving the Skipper his course to fly, after a careful checking
with his drift indicator, Jack called to Kiwi and they
began the transfer of five more cans of fuel to the big tank.</p>

<p class='c015'>With the air as bumpy as it was now, this was no light
task. Once, when the plane gave a sudden lurch and reared
upward with one of the bumps, Kiwi lost his balance and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>tumbled over on the floor of his compartment; and before he
could pick himself up and rescue the can some of the precious
fluid had been lost. After that he was more careful, and
braced himself securely against the sudden lurching of their
ship.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were twice as long making the transfer this time, but
it was finally accomplished, and Jack heaved the empty cans
overboard. This time Kiwi was unable to follow them on
their downward flight. Often they disappeared from view
within a split second of being hurled out.</p>

<p class='c015'>The broken clouds were making the Skipper’s job of piloting
much more difficult. Trying to keep the plane on an
even keel and follow their set course took all his attention.</p>

<p class='c015'>Intermittent showers beat down upon them, and big raindrops
were carried back along the under side of the wings in
small, hurried rivulets. To Kiwi in the back, with his nose
pressed against the window pane, it seemed like summer
downpours that he had witnessed from their little cabin back
home.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had become accustomed by now to the smooth roar of
the motor, and was not so conscious of the strain on his eardrums.
Through holes in the clouds he could occasionally
see the ocean tossing black and green far beneath them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack wanted to make sure of getting a last bearing on land
before they swung off to the open Atlantic, and asked the
Skipper if he could not drop a little lower under the clouds
so that Newfoundland would be plainly seen.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even under the clouds, which were only about eight hundred
feet above the water, the visibility was very poor. A
thick mist was shutting in on them. They flew on, trusting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to their instruments, and once, later in the afternoon, the
clouds parted for a few moments and gave them just a glimpse
of land nearly dead ahead—not long enough, however, for them
to identify it positively. They hoped for another such break
in the clouds to help them with the navigation.</p>

<p class='c015'>The bumpiness of the air was increasing. Jack caught a
wireless call from some station in Canada, but the message
was so badly garbled by the static that they could not be
sure of its location. The call of some ship could be faintly
heard, but it also was too confused to be of any use to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Between five-thirty and six they ran into an area of clear
weather, which lasted long enough for them to place definitely
the land ahead as Cape Race. It was just what they needed,
and confirmed Jack’s navigation figures. Using it as their
last point of land, Jack changed their course slightly and
the real ocean voyage began.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were not sure they had been sighted at this point,
but rather hoped so, and that the world would know they
were well on their way. Below them the sea looked angry
and was flecked with white.</p>

<p class='c015'>In his mind’s eye, Kiwi had pictured this breaking away
from land, and had thought that he would be able to look
far to the eastward across the Atlantic and feel its immensity.
He was not so fortunate, for directly ahead and seeming to
bear down upon them were ragged gray clouds, and rolling
along the surface of the water a thick gray fog.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane was still being tossed about by the confused
wind, and now that they had their last bearing determined,
it was the Skipper’s idea to try and climb over these clouds.
They were soon amongst them. Darkness seemed to shut in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>almost at once, and the Skipper switched on the running
lights on the instrument board. Jack was watching his instruments
closely, checking their drift.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi, having no light in his compartment, crept up on the
tank and lay there watching the progress of their plane
through these dense clouds. The hand on their altimeter
slowly turned ... three thousand feet ... four thousand
... and if anything the clouds seemed thicker. The fog condensed
on the windows of their cockpit and was carried
backwards in wisps of water. Five thousand ... six thousand
... still as dark as ever. The wing-tips could scarcely
be seen.</p>

<p class='c015'>At times the plane would plunge and rear, and Kiwi had to
brace himself to stay in position.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the time they had reached nine thousand feet the darkness
seemed a little less dense. At ten thousand they came
out into comparative twilight. But even here they could
not see the stars for there were other light masses of clouds
above them.</p>

<p class='c015'>A long time passed, with only the drone of the motor to be
heard, and with nothing to be seen except piled up clouds in
every direction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Kiwi must have dozed, for he awoke feeling stiff and cold,
how much later he did not know. It took him a few seconds
to realize where he was. Then he saw Dad still at the stick
and Jack bending over his wireless key, tiny blue sparks
showing that he was sending a message. Kiwi was just able
to follow the code which told him that Jack was asking
some ship if his signals were loud. The clock on the instrument
board said half past two. The ship replied, and Jack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>wrote the message out on a little pad beside his instrument
and showed it to the Skipper:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Signals very loud. You must be near. Can you see our
lights? Some fog on the surface.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>Another hour passed. The same ship sent word that the
signals were getting fainter. But another ship broke in, gave
its position and the ship’s operator, and then sent:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your signals strong enough to knock our heads off. What
is your height? You must be just over us. We will send up
rockets. Tell us if they are seen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>All three watched on every side, but nothing except a
tumbled mass of clouds met their gaze. The air up here was
getting colder. Kiwi shivered. The Skipper, looking back,
noticed him, and it crossed his mind that in the excitement
he had forgotten to open the heater which ran from the exhaust
pipe on the engine. It was the work of a moment to
throw the lever over, and almost at once they felt the warm
air come up into the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack took over the controls for a little time, and the Skipper
and Kiwi transferred the last of the extra fuel to the big
tank and disposed of the empty cans.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper made a hurried check of their fuel supply in
both the wing tanks and the main one, and appeared to be
well content with the way it was holding out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was taking small cat-naps on the top of the tank and
beginning to wonder if it were not time to eat again. It was
still dark and there was nothing to be seen—no moon, no
stars, just a gray pall on every side.</p>

<p class='c015'>He awoke from a longer one of these naps to find it much
lighter and the lights on the instrument board looking very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>yellow in the daylight. Jack was just saying, “I think I’ve
picked up the government radio station at Malin Head,
Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c015'>While Jack was trying to pick up their message, the Skipper
leaned forward to switch off the instrument-board lights, and
as he did so he glanced out the window along the wing on
Jack’s side and made an alarming discovery.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fuel pipe line from the wing tank ran along the outside
surface of the wing for a short distance, and then curved
down to the fuselage, where it came through to the main
tank and the carburetor. In the curved part was a flexible
joint which had evidently vibrated loose, for streaking out
behind was a flow of their precious fuel. There was no way of
knowing how long this had been going on.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper had a terrible sinking sensation as he realized
what the consequences of this tiny leak might be. Perhaps
gallons had even now been lost and the seriousness of it appalled
him. They would need every drop they had to reach
India, and already enough might have escaped to ruin their
chances of even making Europe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='c021'>MID-ATLANTIC</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c014'>WITHOUT a word the Skipper touched Jack on the
arm. He looked up, and the Skipper pointed to
their trouble. As Jack took off his earphones,
he mechanically sent out “Stand by.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Both Jack and the Skipper turned over in their minds plans
for remedying this trouble. The Skipper immediately turned
off the flow of fuel that was being pumped into the right
wing tank from the main tank. The fuel remaining in the
wing tank continued to leak out, for it came through the pipe
line into the carburetor by gravity. By adjusting his valves
the Skipper drew on his supply in the left wing tank.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were in a desperate plight. Something must be done
at once to stop this leak. Although they had tried to provide
for every emergency, here was one which would tax their ingenuity
to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had a large roll of tape and a bottle of liquid similar
to shellac in the equipment; but whether Jack could reach back
far enough to tape the break was doubtful. However, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>opened the sliding window beside him and tried it. For the
first time in his life he regretted his broad shoulders, for the
small window gave him no room in which to work. Once
the rush of the wind nearly tore the tape from his hands. He
slipped back into his seat to rest for a moment, after the
twisting strain he had been under.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had been watching with absorbed interest while this
maneuver was going on. He asked Dad if he might try. The
Skipper said it was impossible; but Jack was on Kiwi’s
side and thought it might be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a little jockeying they got Kiwi down to the window,
and with Jack holding firmly to his legs he leaned far out and
attempted to wrap the tape around the break. The rushing
of the wind was more than he had counted on, and he felt it
pull and claw at his clothes as he hung half out of the window.
In this awkward position it was almost impossible for
him to do anything, and he motioned to Jack to haul him
back into the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Kiwi put forth the suggestion which made both the
Skipper and Jack catch their breath. Would Jack help him
through the window and lower him until his feet touched
the struts which supported the wing, where he felt that he
could brace himself and do the job?</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi saw a look of horror pass over Dad’s face, but he was
sure it could be done. Using all the arguments he could
think of, he at last convinced Jack, and Dad grudgingly gave
his consent for the try.</p>

<p class='c015'>Slipping out of his jacket so that Jack could get a firm hold
on the leather belt at his waist, Kiwi started, feet first,
through the window. Inch by inch he wormed his way out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>reaching with his feet for the strut where it joined the
fuselage.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper banked the plane over to help Kiwi as much
as he could. He saw the perspiration stand out on Jack’s face,
and noticed its set expression as Kiwi’s feet groped about for
support. Another inch and he might reach it! The force of
the wind was terrific.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi, under this strain, was not conscious of the cold now.
He had to look down to find the strut. Just at this time they
were passing over mountains of clouds. He caught a glimpse,
hundreds of feet below, of a yawning cloud valley with the
churning masses of gray fog in a whirling turmoil. Its awful
immensity scared him for a second. Then he located the strut
with his foot and tested its strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>As soon as Jack felt that Kiwi had some support, he lowered
him until both his feet were pressed against the strut.
Then Kiwi slowly faced around and found that he could just
reach the pipe line. The orange side of the plane stretched
out behind him, and he was vaguely conscious of the word
“Dauntless” in huge block letters.</p>

<p class='c015'>Keeping a grip on Kiwi’s belt with one hand, Jack with
his other hand passed out the roll of tape, and the slow work
of winding it commenced. Inch by inch Kiwi wound, the
fuel freezing his fingers in the terrific cold. He had one
layer completed, and Jack passed out the shellac. Somehow
or other he got a coat of it over the tape. It dried almost
instantly, and the difficult work of another layer was begun.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi signalled to Jack that he must rest, and Jack eased
him over to the side, where he hung shaking with weariness
from his efforts.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The Skipper was undergoing untold tortures, for he could
only guess at what was going on. Jack’s body at the window
shut off his view of Kiwi. He was doing everything in his
power to hold the plane steady, using every particle of his
skill to keep the bumps from causing Kiwi to lose his footing.</p>

<p class='c015'>But in spite of all the Skipper’s efforts, one particularly
vicious bump caused Kiwi to slip, and for just a second he
wondered wildly if Jack could hold him from dropping off
into that awesome space. His feet found the struts again,
and he rested.</p>

<p class='c015'>Slowly another layer was put on, and the flow stopped.
To make sure, another coat of shellac was put on and another
layer of tape. Just then a few drops of rain warned of another
shower.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last the job was finished, and only time could tell if it
would hold.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then came the struggle to get the boy back into the plane.
Slowly and painfully he was drawn up to the level of the
window. With a final tug he was pulled inside, and Jack,
with his last remaining strength, lifted Kiwi to the top of
the tank.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were an exhausted crew for the next few minutes,
there in the middle of the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c015'>A great deal of altitude had been lost, and they were now
in the midst of churning clouds. It was quite probable that
the Skipper, in trying to make things as easy as possible
for Jack and Kiwi during their terrific ordeal, had gone considerably
off the course. In tipping the plane over sideways
he had flown in big circles, and it was necessary that they
lose no time in resuming their straight flight.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
<img src='images/i092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The Skipper at once began to climb back above the clouds.
The plane was still soaked from the rain squalls they had
passed through. Not long after, they came out into the
bright sunshine, and there directly ahead of them, like a
promise for their success, was a tremendous rainbow. It reassured
their worn spirits, and the Skipper pointed it out to
Kiwi with the comforting words:</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s your pay for a good job done.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i093.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>It was unlike rainbows seen on the ground, for the delicate
colors made a complete circle. Kiwi looked down and there
on the uneven surface of a cloud was the distinct shadow of
their plane moving toward the rainbow. Then the plane
seemed to pass completely through it. Surely a good omen
for the success of their flight.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The Skipper felt that there could be no better time than
this for a little food. They finally located a package of sandwiches,
and he and Jack refreshed themselves from the thermos
bottle. The coffee was still piping hot. Kiwi, after eating
a sandwich, finished the other orange that Old Bill had
given him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Their spirits rose tremendously. Jack put on his head-phones
and put out a call to find some one who would verify
their position.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i094.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The Malin Head station in Ireland got signals through to
Jack much plainer than they had in earlier attempts. After
some trying, Jack got the latitude and longitude of Malin
Head and their directional bearing. Locating on the map
the Malin Head station, and drawing a line on the map on
the bearing the station had given him, meant that a similar
bearing from a different angle would locate the plane’s position
over the Atlantic. He now needed a check-up from
another station.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The <i>Aquitania</i>, twelve hours out of Cherbourg, sent its position,
and from its directional radio the bearing. It was then
the work of but a moment to make the necessary calculations,
and Jack placed his pencil point down upon the chart
and said, “Well, that’s where we are now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>About half of their water crossing had been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still Kiwi had no view of the ocean under them. In the
hours since they had left the coast of Newfoundland, they
had always been in the clouds or had had a heavy layer beneath
them. They were flying at about eight thousand feet,
and ahead of them now was a huge wall of clouds that seemed
to extend upward fully eighteen thousand feet. The light
shone on them, lighting up the peaks and valleys of the cloud
mountains. They approached the clouds rapidly, and once
in them the plane was plunged into a heavy twilight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The air bumps here were terrific, tossing them about, and
the Skipper was obliged to keep his eye constantly on the
bank and climb indicator in order to keep the plane on anything
resembling an even keel. As they had entered the
clouds the wind had been nearly dead astern, and here in the
murky darkness they were compelled to trust solely to their
instruments for navigation. The wind caught them up in
fierce eddies, and swirls of gray clouds sucked up past them.
Flashes of lightning darted here and there. The plane seemed
to have no more stability than a kite.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s heart leaped as one tremendous bolt of lightning
flashed before his eyes, just ahead. He felt the entire plane
quiver under the impact of the blows struck by the wind.
They had become accustomed to the roar of the motor, and now
it seemed as though they could hear the noise of the storm.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>As the wind howled by, they could feel the air growing
colder and colder. Kiwi watched the magnetic compass, set
up high above the instrument board, swing first one way and
then the other with the twisting and turning of the plane as
it was buffeted by the winds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack had stopped all attempts to use his wireless, and had
his spare control stick in place ready to help the Skipper
should he tire from his tremendous exertions. Both their
faces showed the strain of flying through the storm.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the cold increased, sleet began to beat against the windows,
and Jack glanced out uneasily to catch the first indication
of ice forming on their wings. He realized the seriousness
of such a happening. The upper and lower surface of the
wing was cambered, or curved, in a scientific way to help lift
the load of the plane, and anything that changed this curve
would destroy its lifting power. Therefore at the first sign
of ice forming on the wings they must begin a hunt for
warmer air currents. Ice often formed with great rapidity,
and knowing this both the Skipper and Jack watched closely
for the first tell-tale sign. The engine was throttled back
about a quarter to the best cruising speed.</p>

<p class='c015'>There seemed to be no end to the storm. It had been nearly
half an hour since they had left the clear sunshine and entered
into this ominous twilight. They had held their altitude,
knowing that it was no use to try to climb above the
clouds, and having no assurance that it would be better lower
down. Every little while rain would suddenly fall, and as
suddenly stop.</p>

<p class='c015'>All at once they were conscious of a thin film of the dreaded
ice forming over the cockpit windows. Jack slipped back the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>glass panel and looked out. There on the leading edge of the
wing was the unmistakable sign that ice was starting to
form. In uneven lumps it was building slowly backwards....</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack told the Skipper the disquieting news and shouted to
Kiwi to slide back to his window in the rear compartment to
see if the trailing edge of the wing was also gathering ice.
Kiwi’s window was not as badly obscured as were those in
front. He could see a thin layer of ice on the trailing edge
working forward with great rapidity, and he crept over the
tank to report this to Dad.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll try it lower,” Dad said. “We may strike some
warm air there.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Shutting off the engine as much as he dared, they coasted
on down and down.</p>

<p class='c015'>They tried it at the five thousand foot level for a few
minutes. If anything they accumulated ice faster.</p>

<p class='c015'>They went down another thousand feet. The plane seemed
to be much heavier on the controls. Still no halt in the
gathering of the ice.</p>

<p class='c015'>The situation was becoming desperate, and the Skipper told
Jack to try and get into communication with some ship. If
the ice kept on forming it would mean that they would have
to land on the water in another fifteen or twenty minutes. In
order to fly level it was necessary to run their engine almost
at its maximum.</p>

<p class='c015'>They brought the plane lower down, and still they could
see nothing but swirling clouds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack was sending out their call letter with the S O S to show
that they were in trouble. He got a feeble answer, and worked
with his instruments trying to bring it nearer and clearer.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Still the hateful ice piled onto them. Extending back from
the leading edge of the wing it was now fully an inch thick.
It was freezing in the narrow slots of their ailerons. The
Skipper was finding it increasingly difficult to balance the
plane sideways.</p>

<p class='c015'>He came down to a thousand feet, straining his eyes for a
glimpse of the ocean underneath. All was gray and murky.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack was working feverishly with his sending key and
listening for an answer to his calls. Two ships in their eagerness
to help were interfering with the reception of either
message.</p>

<p class='c015'>The engine was now wide open, and they were staggering
along under the load of ice. They could not see the tail of
the plane, but knew from the way the elevator operated that
it, too, was covered with ice. Slowly they were losing altitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack was getting one of the calls a little better. The ship
was sending her position and asking for theirs. The Skipper,
now thoroughly alarmed and feeling that they were to be
forced into the water, called to Kiwi to get their collapsible
boat and put it where it could be reached in an instant. It
was stored in the rear.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi made his way back, unlashed it from where it hung,
and started forward. As he crept to the front he saw Jack,
every nerve tense, trying to make out the code, and Dad
straining his eyes to catch the first glimpse of the heaving
water.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nothing but the deep grayish blue everywhere.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly, out of the gloom ahead, they made out a white
shape rising straight up a hundred feet above them. It looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>pale and ghostly. There was no time to figure out what it
might be. The Skipper instinctively yanked the stick back.
The plane staggered up, making a valiant effort to obey the
demands of its pilot. Jack glanced up from his instruments
just in time to see this white spectre approaching with terrific
speed. He turned a look of amazement and horror upon
the Skipper.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>The plane climbed ever so sluggishly, but as the shape came
rushing at them they saw that it would be cleared if only by
a matter of inches.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s an iceberg!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper pushed the stick forward and leveled out just
as their flying speed was dropping to an alarming extent. He
was hardly quick enough, for one wing dropped and they
started into a flat spin. At once the Skipper put the nose
down until they had flying speed.</p>

<p class='c015'>They rushed along. Realizing that there might be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>bergs in the neighborhood, both watched ahead with a
fascinated gaze. They saw two more—one to their right,
so close that their throats tightened with the fear of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Strangely enough the air here seemed a little warmer. The
plane was handling better, and they began to hope that the
ice was not gaining on them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty minutes went by, and they began to feel a little
easier. Now there was no doubt but that they had hit a
warm air current and the ice was melting.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper was able to throttle back the engine and still
keep an altitude of about one hundred feet above the ocean.
They were close enough now to see the mighty heave of its
waters, the blue-black of its surface broken here and there
by white foam as the waves broke.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another hour they hurtled along, the air getting clearer,
when suddenly Kiwi noticed away to their right a big ship
plunging along. The red of her funnels and the white of her
decks contrasted sharply with the dullness of the background.
He pointed it out to the two men in front, and the Skipper
bore over toward it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Send them a message, Jack, that we’ll keep going,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack started with his key, sent out his call letter, and
waited for its acknowledgment. The answer came, very
faint:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your signals weak. Can hardly hear you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He tried again. The answer was just audible.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can’t hear you. Are you sending?”</p>

<p class='c015'>By this time they were very close to the ship and Jack
shouted to the Skipper:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Something wrong with the wireless. They can’t hear
us.”</p>

<p class='c015'>During the next few seconds it took to come abreast the
ship, it flashed through the Skipper’s mind that at the time
of their narrow escape from the iceberg it was quite possible
that their wireless aerial, trailing underneath, had been torn
off. He barked out to Jack:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Try sending the message with your flashlight!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the numberless things that had been stowed away
aboard the plane, Jack had provided himself with a powerful
flashlight to use in such an emergency.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they swooped low over the ship they could see the rails
lined with passengers staring up at them. Jack opened his
window and thrusting the flashlight over the side started
blinking the message as the Skipper tilted the plane over
and began a wide circle around the liner.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was craning his neck over Jack’s shoulder, and saw
a light sending out flashes from the bridge. Profiting by Jack’s
training, he was able to read the ship’s message. It said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your flashes too weak. Can’t read them.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Informed of this, the Skipper decided that they would have
to write a note and try to drop it on the decks.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack hastily wrote out the message:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Trouble over. We’re going on. Your position, please.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Looking for something with which to weight it, his eye
lighted on one of the bottles of water, and with a rubber
band that he had been using to keep his writing pad in position,
he fastened the note to the bottle and signalled the
Skipper to fly into position to drop it.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper swung in a wide circle and approaching the
ship from the stern as slowly as he could, he yelled to Jack:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Heave it out when you’re ready!”</p>

<p class='c015'>As they flew directly over the ship they felt a great air
bump as they crossed the smoke-stacks and were struck by
the heated column of air. As they passed the bow of the
boat Jack leaned far out and threw the bottle downward.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi felt the plane lurch as Dad turned it quickly to watch
the bottle’s descent. It went hurtling down, and for a second
it seemed as though it would strike the bridge. Then the
wind caught it, it struck one of the lifeboats and bounded off
into the water. It was disheartening, but they must try again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack wrote a repetition of the message, and then was at a
loss to know what he could use to weight it with. There
was just one more bottle of water, and it was too precious to
use for this purpose. Both Jack and the Skipper thought
fast. Then the Skipper said, “Here,” and reaching into his
inside pocket beneath his flying suit, he pulled out a cigarette
case. It was a silver case, heavily engraved, that the men of
his squadron had presented to him at Christmas, 1918, after
the war had ended.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Jack made a sign that it was a shame to risk it, but the
Skipper shrugged his shoulders, and Jack hastily added to
the message, “Return this case to Captain McBride later.”
He slipped the message inside the case and clicked it shut.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper jockeyed into position for another try. This
time he came down even lower and kept to the leeward side
of the ship. Rushing along nearly on a level with the top
decks, they had passed the ship before Jack had time to hurl
his message.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again the Skipper swung the plane around, and this time
as he drew alongside Jack leaned out and threw the case with
all his might. It went spinning toward the ship, sailed over
the rail, struck a hatchway, and was pounced upon by one
of the stokers on the forward deck.</p>

<p class='c015'>The crowd on board waved frantically to the plane above.
The “Dauntless” swung in a wide circle and came back over
the ship for the last time. A puff of steam from the whistle
and a flashing light on the bridge showed that those on
board had read the plane’s message were sending them the
ship’s position and a “good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Straightening out on their course, after Jack had read the
ship’s answer, they flew on at top speed and soon left the
ship far behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi scrambled back to his little window, and with his
face pressed against the pane saw the liner melt into the
haze. A great feeling of loneliness came over him as he saw it
disappear from view. The fleeting glimpse he had had of other
human beings had served to bring home to him their utter
detachment from the world. He commenced to realize how
long they had been on their way, and thinking back over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>their trials and adventures he suddenly felt very weary. He
longed for sleep, but Dad called out:</p>

<p class='c015'>“How about some lunch, Kiwi?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi unwrapped his own sandwiches and climbing up on
the tank offered them to Dad and Jack, but found that they
were already busy with some of their own. The food and
coffee seemed to cheer up the two men, and the engine
hummed merrily along carrying them on their way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sitting crouched on the top of the tank, Kiwi’s head nodded
several times. Feeling himself slipping off into slumber, he
stretched out. Above the noise of the engine he could hear
Dad singing with great gusto an old negro spiritual that he
was very fond of:</p>

</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Kiwi must have slept for a couple of hours. He awoke
with the feeling that something was wrong. Almost instantly
he discovered that the steady beat of the engine had
changed. It was missing and spluttering and the plane was
vibrating in a terrifying way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack was working with his wireless instrument. Kiwi saw
him shake his head and complain, “Nothing I can do will
bring those signals loud enough to be of any use.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He gave it up and the Skipper asked him to check up the
amount of fuel they had left in their tanks. Yes, there was
plenty of fuel, for the Skipper nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were above the clouds. As far as the eye could see
they were stretched out in a rolling plain, looking for all
the world like drifted snow. They looked solid enough to
land upon.</p>

<p class='c015'>If their engine failed to pick up within the next few minutes,
they would lose altitude until there was nothing left
to do but crash ... and their flight would end in disaster.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='c021'>CONDITIONS CHANGE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c014'>THE sun was getting lower in the heavens, but having
spent so much time in the murky twilight of the
clouds, the light still seemed very bright to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The clouds beneath them remained unchanged. Kiwi looked
straight down and watched them as they drifted by until
he became almost giddy. He called Jack’s attention to the
shadow of the plane racing across this uneven surface.</p>

<p class='c015'>Soon the sun disappeared from view, but the uncanny light
still held. They flew on and on. There was nothing to see
in all this vast plain.</p>

<p class='c015'>No one seemed to be able to reason out where this uncanny
light was coming from since the sun had set. All felt that a
change had come over them. Where a few minutes before
they had stared at disaster, now they ceased to worry about
their engine or its failure.</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane nearly flew itself. There were no bumps, and it
needed very slight correction at the controls to keep it on
its course. The clear light seemed to come from tiny bright
particles in the air such as one sees on a dewy morning.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Gradually Kiwi became conscious of something ahead. Far
off on the horizon the rolling clouds seemed to merge into
something else. Could it be hills that he saw? He looked at
their altimeter. It showed that they were flying at about
twelve thousand feet. He glanced back to the horizon, and
the land seemed plainer. He thought he must be dreaming.
He rubbed his eyes vigorously and looked again. It was
still there.</p>

<p class='c015'>He glanced at Dad and Jack to see if they, too, had discovered
it. Jack’s head was nodding and he appeared to be
asleep. Dad was leaning forward with an intent gaze, brushing
the back of his hand across his eyes as though he, too,
could hardly believe that what he saw was true.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi saw him throw a quick glance across at Jack’s charts,
study them for a moment, and then look quickly ahead again.
The apparition was still there. The Skipper studied it for
some minutes. It seemed miles and miles away, but was getting
plainer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi thought he could see darker masses slightly to the
left.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad was still straining forward, and without moving his
eyes from the horizon nudged Jack. Jack came to with a
start, noticed the Skipper’s tense attitude, and peered ahead
through that peculiar light. Slowly he, too, discovered those
strange shapes. He consulted his map, then the compass and
drift-indicator. Puzzled, he turned to the Skipper. Plainly
here was something that neither could understand. At last
Jack was able to say:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can it be a mirage?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Without moving his eyes from it, the Skipper replied:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“It’s possible. Early one morning over St. Omer in France,
I saw something like it for a few seconds. But this has been
in sight now for some time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With each passing second the apparition was becoming a
little more distinct.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi leaned forward, and asked:</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is that, Dad? Have we reached land?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad shook his head, and there was another long pause as
they all studied this appearance of land ahead. Jack looked
at his charts and knit his brows. He went over their course
on the map and shook his head, as puzzled as ever. He could
find no solution.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now the hills, instead of coming nearer, seemed to recede.
It should be night now, if their clock and watches were
right. The dazzling light still puzzled them.</p>

<p class='c015'>A little later, Jack turned to the Skipper and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t that look like a plane just above the horizon?”</p>

<p class='c015'>In another few minutes they made out several more circling
just over the hilltops. And then, off to the right, they could
see about a dozen planes flying in formation. They also decided
that some tiny specks on what seemed to be the surface
of the clouds were other planes, resting there.</p>

<p class='c015'>A look of helplessness was beginning to cloud the Skipper’s
face. There had been few times in his flying experience when
he had not had a very good idea of where he was. Once or
twice he had been lost in the air, and it carried with it a
feeling such as one never has when lost on the ground. On
the ground, even on the darkest night and in a strange country,
there was always the possibility of meeting someone
who could supply directions, or of finding a signboard that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>would locate one. But in the air there was no passing stranger
or friend that one could ask for help.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper remembered the first time that he had been
hopelessly lost in the air.</p>

<p class='c015'>It had happened while he was training in England. He had
flown to an airdrome several miles from his own, hoping to
find there an old friend and to renew acquaintances. He had
followed a railroad line, which in almost every case is perfectly
visible from the air and is the shortest connecting link
between cities and towns. This particular railroad skirted in
a wide circle a town near the airdrome he was to visit, and
it was joined there by several other branches of the road.</p>

<p class='c015'>Locating the airdrome, he landed. As he came down a
severe rainstorm had swept over the field. Upon learning
that his friend had been transferred to another airdrome, he
was anxious to be off and away; but those at the field counselled
him to wait until the storm was over.</p>

<p class='c015'>In about twenty minutes the heavens above the field were
clear, and he took off to return to his own airdrome. Picking
up the railroad line again, he was confronted with the problem
of deciding which branch he must follow. Relying on
his compass, which he had every reason to believe was
accurate, he chose the one that seemed to lead off in the right
direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>He had followed it for some time at an altitude of about
five thousand feet when he overtook the same storm. The
tops of the clouds were too high to surmount. They also
extended nearly to the ground, and were emptying torrents
of rain over miles of country. There was nothing to do but
fly through them; and although in those days he had had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>little or no experience in flying a compass course, he felt
that now would be a good time to practise it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Entering the clouds he had been appalled at the turmoil.
The swirling winds carried him this way and that. He was
dropped down fifty or a hundred feet and as quickly snatched
up and carried upwards. He fought the storm for half an
hour, marveling at the force of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>His whole attention was devoted to keeping his plane on
an even keel. Occasionally he glanced at his compass to see
it turning this way and that, so that he had only a hazy
idea of his general course. He watched, fascinated, as the
lightning played through the thick clouds. Always he kept
a close watch downward to catch the first view of the ground,
hoping against hope that his guiding railway line would appear
somewhere.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the air did clear below, he was horrified to find
nothing but water beneath him. For a matter of seconds he
flew on, hoping that it might prove to be a lake or the wide
mouth of a river.</p>

<p class='c015'>Slowly it was borne in on his consciousness that he was
out over the North Sea and that very probably his compass
had been playing him tricks and could not be depended upon.
However, the right way <i>must</i> be back, and losing no time he
swung his plane around and started in that direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>Almost at once he was again swallowed up by the storm,
the rain coming down upon him in torrents.</p>

<p class='c015'>His goggles became obscured and he pushed them up to
get a clearer view ahead. The unaccustomed rush of wind
and rain in his eyes made it impossible for him to see with
any distinctness. After coming through the storm the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>time, he had promised himself that never again would he
voluntarily repeat such an experience. But here he was back
in it again, fighting as hard as before to keep the plane flying
in some semblance of a straight line. He could keep no track
of the time, and when the storm did lessen he felt that it must
have been hours that he had been fighting those contrary
swirls of air.</p>

<p class='c015'>A great feeling of relief welled up in him as he at last saw
land underneath. Even though he had no idea of his location,
at least there was solid ground under him. Bewildered, he
looked for a sign—some town or some familiar forest formation—that
would locate him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Off to one side he saw a railroad line. Whether it was the
same one that he had been following or not, he could not
tell. But it would surely lead him to a place that might help
him. The plane he was flying was a difficult one to land on
a small or uneven field, and he had no intention of taking
that risk unless it was necessary.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sighting a town ahead he flew low, hoping to read the
sign on the railroad station. His eyes still smarted from the
rain. The station proved to be too well surrounded by telegraph
wires on tall poles and the chimneys of a factory to
permit him to fly near enough to make out the name.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was completely lost. There was no doubt of it. There
was nothing to do but go on, even though his fuel supply
was getting dangerously low.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another town, some distance away, lay wrapt in a haze.
Approaching, he was overjoyed to recognize in the center of
it a large, star-shaped building, probably a hospital. From
this point he knew he could find his way. He remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>that near by there was a large country house surrounded by
a formal garden. He looked in the direction where he expected
to see it, but it was not there. When he did locate
the house it seemed completely turned around, and he had
to readjust himself to this changed condition before he could
shape his course for home. As he did so, and the compass
ceased its slow turning, he discovered that it was off many
points and had been one of the causes of his bewilderment. He
was now able to find his way to his own airdrome without
further trouble.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, again, the Skipper had the same peculiar, lost sensation.
Even though he had Jack, an expert navigator, with
him, the situation in which he found himself brought back
the old baffled, hopeless feeling. It had been a long time
since they had left the ship behind—since they had seen anything
but this rolling plain of clouds—and now they were
facing a situation so unusual that he felt numb trying to
understand it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Land seemed to be ahead where their charts told them no
land could be. Several planes were flying in their direction.
One, large and unwieldy, approached quite close, its occupants
leaning over the side, studying them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi thought he knew every type of plane that was being
flown in his day and age, but he had never seen one like this
before. Jack pointed it out to the Skipper and they both
examined it closely.</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly the Skipper blurted out, “Why it’s a Gotha!”</p>

<p class='c015'>As the plane came nearer to them it dipped lower and made
its ponderous way to one side; then it swung in a wide circle
and drew close behind them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>As they flew on, other planes passed above and beneath
them, and the Skipper’s face grew more and more bewildered
as he identified, one after another, planes long obsolete in the
flying world. A monoplane, such as Bleriot had made history
with in crossing the English Channel some twenty years ago,
appeared. Early types used in the war swooped down upon
them.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they sailed along the great plateau, more and more
planes whose pilots seemed filled with curiosity came into
view.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were being hemmed in closer and closer. Dotted here
and there on the surface were machines of every conceivable
design. The crew of the “Dauntless” were at a loss to explain
it all.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stretched out on his perch on the top of the tank Kiwi was
immensely interested in the sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>One pilot in an old bombing plane, a clumsy flyer at best,
edged in so close to get a better view that the Skipper had to
turn sharply to avoid a collision. Everywhere they looked
were antiquated planes continually closing in on them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper began to fear that he would never be able to
pilot the “Dauntless” through this swarm. As they twisted
and turned, Jack leaned from his window and tried to signal
the other planes that they <i>must</i> stay farther away. They
were like a cloud of birds pecking at an owl who had looted
their nests. The Skipper grew nervous at the thought of
being driven down to a landing.</p>

<p class='c015'>There seemed to be a concerted action to keep the “Dauntless”
from continuing its flight. Try as he would, the Skipper
could find no way in which to shake off these persistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>pursuers. Their motor which a short time before, with its
missing and spluttering, had brought their hopes of ever
seeing India to an end, now functioned with absolute perfection.</p>

<p class='c015'>Constantly they were being driven closer to the surface,
and even though they had outdistanced some of the heavier
and slower machines, others had taken up the chase and
were frolicking about them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was delighted with their tumbling antics.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a few minutes more they were so close to the ground
that there was nothing left for them to do but land. The
Skipper, his face red with anger, yanked back the throttle;
the motor quieted down till the propeller was just ticking
over. They glided rapidly in. The wheels found support on
the surface. They had landed.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='c021'>ANOTHER WORLD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c014'>AS the plane rolled to a stop, both Jack and the Skipper
found their tongues. What was the meaning of this
performance? Why were they forced down? Where
had they landed? Certainly these other pilots were not treating
them or their flight to India with the seriousness that they
deserved.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper remarked in a disgusted tone of voice as they
climbed out:</p>

<p class='c015'>“It looks like a good-for-nothing training ground for pilots
from all over the world, except that most of them can fly and
fly well.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The other planes were now landing all around them and
their pilots, clambering out, hurried over and started examining
every detail of their machine. They were a good-natured
lot and seemed to have no idea of harming them in any way.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was still in the cockpit of the plane, not knowing
what to do. Several of the pilots spied him. Plainly delighted
they shouted to him to come out and join them.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The Skipper, still bewildered, looked up as Kiwi started
to climb through the window, and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Watch out, Kiwi! Better let me help you down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With that a great shout went up from the crowd:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here’s a Kiwi!”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was then that the crew of the “Dauntless,” looking about,
realized that there was nothing but pilots anywhere in sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a commotion on the edge of the crowd, and elbowing
his way in was a tall young man wearing a British
officer’s uniform. Grasping the Skipper by the shoulders, he
swung him around and then blurted out:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if it isn’t Skipper McBride, of all people!”</p>

<p class='c015'>At the same time the Skipper recognized him and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, Thorne, what are you doing here? And where are
we, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Thorne told him that he had been there for a long, long
time—he could scarcely remember how long.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We keep no track of time in this place, Skipper. You’re
in another world now. The nights follow the days and we
have nothing to worry about.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he wanted to know who Jack was and also who the
boy was.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper explained to him hurriedly of their flight and
of their hopes of landing in India; how Kiwi, who was his
son, had at the last minute stowed away aboard the plane,
and how he had been able to help them in their journey over
the water.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thorne suggested that they get out of their flying clothes,
and that he would take them to a place where they could
rest up.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>As Jack was removing his suit, Thorne and one or two of
the others spoke up:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well—here’s the Navy! There’s a whole crowd of your
fellows here, and no doubt you’ll find many friends among
them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They had started off toward the edge of the field when the
Skipper stopped and asked if something could not be done
for their plane. Thorne waved him aside with, “Oh, it’s all
right where it stands. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As they were walking along, Thorne became interested in
Kiwi, and asked him how he liked flying. Kiwi, who had
admired Thorne immensely from the first, chattered to him of
their adventures in the clouds and of their narrow escape
from the iceberg.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arriving at the edge of the field they were made comfortable.
Then a message came for Jack that a crowd of his
Navy friends, hearing of his arrival, would be landing soon
at a nearby field, and would he come over and join them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jack left, saying that he would return later.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper now took this opportunity to ask Thorne
more about this flying world in which they had landed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Thorne began:</p>

<p class='c015'>“This little kingdom of which you and Jack and Kiwi are
now a part is composed entirely of aviators who, in the other
world, gave their lives for the advancement of aviation.
Among us here are men who made experiments with the
earliest gliders, who tried to fly crazy contraptions built by the
rule of thumb and flown more by confidence than by knowledge.
There are also among us pioneers who tried to find
ways and means of doing impossible things in the air. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>last war contributed hundreds who were the founders of
traditions for the use of aircraft in battle. Some were sacrificed
in order that the need for parachutes for every pilot
should be recognized. Many whose names are even now unknown
in aviation, here have found their place and here their
merits have been recognized. Test pilots, those unsung heroes
of experimentation, form a large part of our numbers. Beginning
with the legendary Icarus and continuing up to the
present time, a steady stream of recruits have flowed into our
kingdom, and they mark the progress of man’s conquest of
the air.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Thorne rattled on, in a way that the Skipper remembered
as characteristic of him in the old days, recounting
stories of pilots they had both known.</p>

<p class='c015'>Both Jack and the Skipper found many friends. Only a
short time before several other planes attempting to cross the
Atlantic had landed here. Two Frenchmen with glorious
war records were part of the group. They told their stories
of fighting the elements over the Atlantic and their experiences
with the treacherous ice.</p>

<p class='c015'>They talked on and on and all seemed anxious to know the
details of any new developments that were being made in
aircraft. Anything that had to do with flying interested them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi sat and drank in their stories. But since his talk
with Thorne, he had had little to say, for he felt that he was
something of an outsider inasmuch as he really did not know
how to fly.</p>

<p class='c015'>As time went on, more flyers gathered round. Some were
old friends of the Skipper’s; others, pilots who knew him or
knew people whom he knew.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Always overhead there were planes tumbling about. Kiwi
looked up and watched them stunting, rolling and looping
like so many swallows on a summer afternoon. All their
motors seemed to run without a skip or a miss, and once or
twice he saw pilots floating lazily down in parachutes apparently
just for the joy of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>An all-red plane came skimming close over their heads.
The Skipper looked up quickly. He pointed it out to Kiwi
and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s a Camel plane. Remember—I told you about
them?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane came back and landed not far away, and a pink-cheeked
young fellow slid to the ground and came on a run
to join their group.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper recognized him at once, and pulling Kiwi to
his feet he said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here’s old Armbruster—the fellow who taught me to
fly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi looked the new man over with the greatest admiration,
for Dad had told him many stories of Armbruster’s flying
skill. He remembered Dad’s telling how he would take
off from the ground into a loop, just missing the field by
inches as he came around; how he had, on a dare, flown
through a long hangar with just a few inches to spare on
either side; how he used to fly across the tops of some saw-tooth
hangars, just touching his wheels lightly on the top
of each peak as he passed. Dad had said that Armbruster
was the most natural flyer he had ever seen. He never needed
instruments to tell him what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster, when he found out who Kiwi was, made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>great fuss over him. He asked Kiwi all about Dad and what
he had been up to. He wanted to know all about their flight
and about the plane they were using. He suggested that he
and Kiwi should go and inspect the “Dauntless.” Of course
Kiwi liked the idea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Leaving Dad gossiping with old friends, they walked over
to where the plane stood and climbed over it. As they were
sitting in the cockpit together, Kiwi turned to Armbruster
with the greatest seriousness and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know, sir, I have never really learned to fly, but
Dad has been promising to teach me for an awfully long
time. Do you think, Mr. Armbruster, maybe you could find
time to do it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster was delighted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sure,” he said. “I know just the plane, and later I will
borrow it and we will send you off in no time.”</p>
<div  class='figright id007'>
<img src='images/i121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>ARMBRUSTER</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>After they had inspected all the instruments, some of which
were new to Armbruster, they climbed out of the cockpit,
Armbruster remarking that never before had he seen such a
big petrol tank in a plane. Then turning to Kiwi, he asked:
“How would you like to
make a tour around and see some
of <i>our</i> machines?”</p>

<p class='c015'>This was just what Kiwi had
been hoping for, and for the next
couple of hours they went from
one plane to another while Armbruster
pointed out their characteristics
and the peculiarities
of each.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>He showed Kiwi a Sopwith-Dolphin, a compact biplane in
which the pilot sat so that his head came above the top
plane. That was a good plane during the war, Armbruster
told him. It could go up high—about 20,000 to 22,000 feet—and
had a back stagger so that the pilot had a good view
both up and down.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then they came to a Spad. Armbruster explained how the
French had used them to splendid advantage, how fast they
were, how beautifully they maneuvered, and finished up by
saying, “All in all, a beautiful bus.”</p>
<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/i122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>SPAD</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Alongside this plane was an enormous Handley-Page, its
body towering above the little Spad, the wheels of its undercarriage
being almost as high as a man. Two Rolls-Royce
engines drove
it through the
air, and while
they were talking
about it
another one
came down to
land, its slow
descent reminding
Kiwi
of a freight
elevator.</p>

<p class='c015'>So they went
from one plane
to another.
Soon they came
to a German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Fokker D7, painted in glaring colors with lavender wings
and a pink body.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster said, “That’s Schaeffer’s machine. He and I
had a good many scraps during the war over around St.
Quentin. However, neither one of us ever did much damage
to the other, although one day he did get a couple of shots
through my center section. If he is around anywhere I want
you to meet him, for he and your Dad had a few skirmishes,
too, in the old days.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster next pointed out an S.E.5, but this was not
new to Kiwi. He had seen several of them back on the field
at New York where they were being used for sky-writing.</p>
<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/i123.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>DOLPHIN</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>A little later they came to where, sitting all alone, was
a rather clumsy-looking
plane,
which Armbruster
said was
a B. E. They
were known to
all the war flyers
as Quirks. Turning
to Kiwi,
Armbruster remarked:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Kiwi, there’s
the plane that
your Dad learned
to fly in, and I
am going to borrow
it and see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>how well you can handle it. It’s a clumsy old thing, but
you will love it before you get through with it. Let’s go
and look up the pilot it belongs to, and if he says the word
I’ll take you for a flip right now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s excitement began to rise, and even though they
had not been able to finish their flight to India, he began to
feel that learning to fly would be compensation enough.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they strolled back in the direction of the group that
surrounded the Skipper, pilots called to them from all sides.
A boy among all these older pilots was considerable of a
curiosity, and they all seemed envious when they learned
that Armbruster was to teach him to fly.</p>
<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/i124.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>FOKKER D.7.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c022'>They rejoined the Skipper and his friends, and Armbruster
started off to find Hamer, who flew the Quirk, to get his permission
to use
the plane.</p>

<p class='c015'>Just then
Kiwi heard
Thorne say:</p>

<p class='c015'>“What happened
to little
Jimmie Dugan?
We heard at
one time that
he would join
us, but no one
has ever seen
him. He certainly
started
for here.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Then the Skipper told the story of Jimmie Dugan and his
adventures, and they found out at last why Jimmie Dugan
never came.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie, though an American, had joined the Canadian
army. From the first he had disliked carrying a rifle and had
got a transfer into a unit of sappers. It was their job to dig
tunnels far out under the lines, pack them full of explosives,
and when they thought the enemy least expected it, touch them
off from a safe distance with an electric fuse.</p>

<p class='c015'>This form of amusement Jimmie had soon tired of and felt
that he needed a little more action out in the open air; therefore
in due time he became a dispatch rider, and sped over the
highways and byways of France on a motor-cycle.</p>
<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/i125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p><i>SE-5</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c022'>Getting a taste of speed, Jimmie looked about him for
something better,
and, as he
expressed it,
“Having
worked <i>under</i>
the ground and
<i>on</i> the ground,
I thought, why
not try the
air?”</p>

<p class='c015'>His commanding
officer,
having in
mind Jimmie’s
smashing destructiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>with motor-cycles, had some misgivings about transferring
him to the Flying Corps. There the possibilities of damage
were increased a hundred fold. However, Jimmie made his
officer’s life miserable until it was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie had learned to fly with only the usual few crashed
undercarriages, and had been hurried out to the front during
March of 1918, when pilots of any kind were in great demand.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arriving at a squadron near Bailleul, Jimmie had been
plunged into the war in the air without the customary few
days in which to get acquainted with the lines. Almost
miraculously he had done his work and escaped injury during
the hectic days that followed upon the enemy’s break-through
in March.</p>

<p class='c015'>Because of the terrific losses in pilots and planes during
those days, Jimmie found himself a veteran of the squadron
within three weeks. Time passed quickly. Every one was
living his life to the hilt, resting his jangled nerves as best he
could during the days it rained or clouds were too low for
work aloft.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the end of six months Jimmie was due for leave. His
orders read that he was to catch the leave-boat for England
on a certain afternoon. A car was leaving the squadron at
eleven o’clock in the morning which would take him to the
coast.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was an unwritten law that pilots need do no flying on the
day that a Channel boat is to take them to England and
comparative safety.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, by this time Jimmie’s whole life was flying and
fighting. As his kit bag was all packed, he decided to go off
with the morning patrol for just one more look at the war.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It was a morning when their part of the front was comparatively
clear of clouds. Off to their left, as they climbed,
they could see banks of broken clouds that became thicker
and heavier toward the horizon where England lay.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they crossed the pock-marked and broken and torn
country where men were living like so many rabbits, Jimmie
sighted up in the sun a group of specks, looking as if a handful
of pebbles had been tossed up there. They had not long
to wait to discover whether they were friend or enemy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Six Fokkers, their noses pointed down, their motors going
full blast, swept down upon them. Jimmie could see the
sun reflecting upon their brightly painted wings.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie’s flight was out-numbered, for one of the S.E.’s had
found it necessary to turn back with engine trouble just before
they arrived at the lines.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fight that followed had no new aspects for Jimmie. It
had happened many times before. The familiar dryness was
in his mouth. He felt the old thrill and tingle of the uncertainty
of it as he pulled over and did a half-roll, making the
first Fokker miss him on its dive.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the confused minutes that followed he had no time to
follow his friends in their efforts. They were all veterans like
himself, and he felt relieved that Campbell, the new man with
the squadron, had left them because of his dud engine before
the fight started.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie was having his own troubles with a fellow in a
Fokker with blue wing-tips. They were evenly matched until
another Fokker, heavily camouflaged, had streaked a line of
tracer bullets through Jimmie’s struts, while his entire attention
had been given to focusing his sights on the blue wing-tips.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>As he yanked his S.E. around to drive this newcomer off,
the fellow for a fraction of a second did the wrong thing, and
a burst from Jimmie’s machine-gun found its mark. The
plane staggered like a wounded thing and went down out of
control.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie turned quickly in time to see his blue wing-tip
fellow engaged by another S.E. They were some distance
off, too far for Jimmie to be of any help for the moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>He looked about for new worlds to conquer. The fight
had broken up his patrol. They were scattered widely, and
now an anti-aircraft battery was devoting its whole attention
to preventing Jimmie from regaining his own side of the
lines.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first burst startled him as it came up alongside and
spread out level with him. The w-u-u-m-p of its explosion
made his machine shudder, and he saw a ragged hole in the
wing about four feet from the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I must fool this fellow,” Jimmie said to himself, and as
two more black, greasy palls of smoke followed the first, he
changed his direction and steered toward them, knowing
that the gunners would change their range slightly
before trying again. Then for a few seconds he twisted and
turned, lost height and gained it again, till the enemy gunners
apparently decided to try for some of the others.</p>

<p class='c015'>Away to his left Jimmie saw another S.E. picking away at
an enemy two-seater. Inasmuch as he had the advantage of
height, he decided to help in this little matter. Getting terrific
speed from a long dive, he zoomed up under the fat belly of the
enemy machine just as the other S.E. was swinging in from
the other side. They both opened up with their guns at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>same time. The two-seater reared up into the air like a bucking
horse, quivered for a moment, slid off on one wing, and a
slow curl of black smoke streamed from it as it went spinning
downward.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie’s heart jumped within him as he saw their enemy
go down. He yelled at the top of his lungs, trying to drown
out the sound of his motor, “Not so bad for a leave day!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Jimmie remembered he must catch the tender before
eleven. He looked at his watch and decided that he could
just make it if he started for home now. He throttled back
his motor a little and made his way north. The wind had
drifted him south and east, but always keeping a sharp lookout
behind he made his way toward home.</p>

<p class='c015'>He felt hot and tired now, and began to think of his leave
and of the two weeks he would spend in England. He knew
old friends would be there, and he began counting up the
money he had saved for this vacation from the war.</p>

<p class='c015'>The erratic shooting of an anti-aircraft group of batteries
brought Jimmie’s mind back to the war with a snap. If these
gunners were shooting at him they were mighty poor marksmen.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then he discovered a Camel machine starting on a long
dive. He looked below to see what was attracting this fellow,
and there only about fifteen hundred feet off the ground was
one of those fat sausage balloons which carry officers in its
basket who correct the fire of the artillery.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie gasped as he thought of this fellow taking a chance
with a balloon, for he knew full well that a Camel had no
business trying that sort of work. They dived too slowly to
be effective, and observation balloons were always heavily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>protected by machine-guns. Having the range of the balloon,
they could surround it with a perfect hail of bullets through
which it was necessary to pass in order to set the balloon on
fire.</p>

<p class='c015'>The thought flashed through Jimmie’s mind, “Well, if that
fellow’s trying it, why shouldn’t I? I still have time to take
a shot at it and catch the leave-boat.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They were both diving now from opposite sides, the
Camel’s guns just starting to spit, when Jimmie was horrified
to see the Camel quiver and burst into flames.</p>

<p class='c015'>This fact was just impressed upon him when he heard the
sing of bullets and the crackle of wood, and felt a stream of
hot metal scrape both his legs. One terrific jolt hit him in
the chest—and he went down.</p>

<p class='c015'>His last conscious thought was of a burning sensation in
his legs, yet there was no fire. All went black before his eyes
and he must have fainted.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Jimmie came to he found himself still strapped in his
seat, the engine pointed straight down in front of him into
comparative darkness, while pale daylight streamed in upon
him over the tail.</p>

<p class='c015'>Slowly he looked about him. The wings were gone!
Turning his head with an effort, he saw them lying twisted
and torn among the red tiles on the roof of the Belgian house
into which he had crashed. Below him was a turmoil of
sound. Deep, gutteral voices spoke in a tongue he did not
understand. He tried to unhook his belt but was too weak
to do it.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
<img src='images/i131.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>After minutes and minutes of talking and shouting, a ladder
was put up beside him, his belt was unhooked, and he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>lifted out of the machine and carried to the floor below.
Here they tried to make him walk, but he found it was impossible.
So they carried him down to the basement of this
house, and there, of all places, he found there had been fixed
up an enemy first-aid station.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie saw the heavy face of the doctor as he bent over
and impersonally examined him. The doctor spoke to an
assistant, they both looked him all over again, and then
the doctor gave a quick, sharp order to the stretcher-bearers
who were waiting. They picked him up and carried him into
another room, setting the stretcher down upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>As he looked around the bare little room, he made out two
other figures—one stretched out in a bunk built into the side
wall and filled with straw, the other on a stretcher near by.
A soldier with a gun leaned against the doorway and inspected
Jimmie curiously.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gradually it came back to Jimmie that it must be eleven
o’clock. There was a pain in his chest which hurt him to
breathe, but still the thought persisted in his mind, “The
car goes at eleven for the leave-boat.” Then he slowly and
painfully realized that the leave-boat was not for him. He
was down ... he had crashed ... he was on the wrong
side of the lines....</p>

<p class='c015'>If he could only breathe easier things wouldn’t be so bad.
Through the doorway came a man dressed all in black with a
long cinnamon-colored beard. Suspended from his neck on a
silver chain was a cross, which he fingered as be made his
way to the figure in the bunk. It came over Jimmie that this
was a priest who had come to give the Last Sacrament to a
man who was not expected to live. The priest finished his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>rites with the man in the bunk, then turned to the figure on the
other stretcher, and again came the low mumble of his voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>He next approached Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Jimmie began to understand that the doctor had sent
him to this room because he was not expected to live. This
worried him not at all. He felt sure that if the obstruction
in his chest could be removed, if he could take one long, deep
breath, everything would be all right.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the priest came toward him, Jimmie set up a great
outcry. Not realizing that the priest might not understand
English, he explained to him over and over again that he <i>must</i>
be sent back to the doctor, and that if the doctor would remove
this lump in his chest all would be well.</p>

<p class='c015'>The priest appeared to be unconvinced. Jimmie half raised
himself on his stretcher, and repeated again and again that
the priest <i>must</i> send for the doctor. At last the priest seemed
willing to humor him in his wish, patted him on the head
and went out of the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>Left alone, Jimmie was more miserable than ever, wondering
if the priest had understood.</p>

<p class='c015'>After what seemed to him an eternity, the priest came back,
gesticulating with his hands to the doctor who accompanied
him. Jimmie repeated his demands and the doctor, apparently
convinced, leaned over, opened Jimmie’s tunic, and after
another examination had him carried back to the operating
room. After a few torturous minutes with a peculiar wire
instrument, the doctor gave a triumphant “Ach!” and held
up for Jimmie’s inspection a piece of metal the size of his
little finger, and saying “Souvenir” handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Jimmie tried, weakly, to take it, drew a long breath, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>almost at once began to feel better. For the next few minutes
the doctor worked rapidly. He bandaged up Jimmie’s chest
and legs, and finishing his task this man in an enemy uniform
seemed as pleased as did Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And then,” the Skipper continued, “when I saw him
after the war was over, he was being helped off a hospital boat
at Folkestone, limping on two canes, it is true, but otherwise
apparently none the worse for wear except that he had no
buttons on his coat, his wings were gone, as were all his
badges of rank.</p>

<p class='c015'>“After I had talked to him for a few minutes I said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘It looks as if the souvenir hunters had been busy with
you. Where are all your buttons and your wings?’</p>

<p class='c015'>“Jimmie replied, with a slow smile:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘I didn’t lose them until after the Armistice. So many
people in Belgium had been good to me, had shown me so
many kindnesses, that I had to do something to reward them.
And it was a very pretty girl who got my wings.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>During the telling of the story of Jimmie Dugan’s adventures,
Kiwi had listened with divided interest. He was ever
on the watch for Armbruster’s return. That he might now get
his chance to learn to fly was of more importance to him than
stories of other days.</p>

<p class='c015'>He did not have long to wait. Very soon the cheery face
of Armbruster appeared, and he called out from a distance:</p>

<p class='c015'>“All right, Kiwi! I’m ready now if you are!”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Skipper looked up quickly. Kiwi put his hand appealingly
on his father’s arm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Captain Armbruster,” he said, “has just promised that
he will teach me to fly. May I go with him?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>By this time Armbruster had come up to the group, and
he explained to the Skipper his plan to teach Kiwi.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I believe I have the same old Quirk that you learned on,”
he said to the Skipper, “and I’m curious to see what sort of
a hand this son of yours has for flying.”</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='c021'>KIWI GETS HIS WINGS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_7 c014'>AS Kiwi, Armbruster and the Skipper moved over to
where the Quirk sat, they were followed by the
entire group who were interested in this novel
experiment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster helped Kiwi into the front seat, and then they
discovered that his legs were too short to reach the rudderbar.
A shout was sent up for more cushions. When two of them
had been wedged in behind the boy’s back he could work the
rudder very easily. His helmet and goggles were adjusted
and the belt holding him in his seat snapped in place. Then
Armbruster attached the telephones so that he could speak
to Kiwi up in the air, and swung himself into the rear seat.
The engine was started.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they left the group of onlookers there were shouts of
encouragement and Jack, who had just come over, called
above the noise of the engine:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Kiwi, don’t loop him the first time up, will you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi grinned, self-consciously.</p>

<p class='c015'>They trundled some distance out on the field and turned
into the wind. Then, with the propeller just ticking over,
Armbruster said:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Now, Kiwi, I am going to teach you to fly very much as
I taught your Dad long ago. No harm can come to you here
in learning to fly. But I know you would like to be just
such a pilot as your Dad is, and so I am going to teach you,
as he was taught, how to overcome the dangers which follow
stalling a plane in the air and what you must do if the engine
stops suddenly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll take the plane off the ground with my set of controls,
and after we get well up in the air I’ll let you fly it straight
with your stick and rudder for a while. You know how it
feels to be up. You know how the rudder works—that it
swings the plane from side to side. You know that the joystick
in your hand moved sidewise keeps your wings balanced;
moved forward sends you down; pulled backward pulls the
nose of the plane up. Now take your feet off the rudder and
let me see both hands outside until I tell you to take over
control.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi did as he was told.</p>

<p class='c015'>Once in the air, Armbruster could not resist stunting the
plane about over the heads of their audience. Kiwi was
treated to an exhibition in flying such as he had never experienced
before. The plane dived toward the group below,
swished up in climbing turns, swung dizzily off on one wing
and, as the wires whistled, pulled sharply around and recovered
its poise. Kiwi had difficulty keeping his sense of balance
or a clear idea of what the plane was doing.</p>

<p class='c015'>After several minutes of such antics they flew straight and,
wiggling the stick violently, Armbruster told Kiwi through
the phones that he might fly it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“First of all,” he said, “just keep the plane straight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Keep the nose on the horizon—pick some point on it and fly
toward it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi felt elated that at last he was actually controlling a
plane. He couldn’t resist pushing the rudder slightly with
his foot to see what effect it would have. It startled him to
find that the slightest pressure sent the nose of the plane
skidding sidewise. He hurriedly tried to correct this with
the other foot, and discovered that he was overdoing it and
that they were see-sawing back and forth in a crazy fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The voice of Armbruster came through the phones:</p>

<p class='c015'>“There, Kiwi, not too much rudder. Rudders are dangerous
things. They have caused a good share of all the
accidents.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had the feeling that Armbruster had hastily corrected
his errors and he gained new respect for the art of flying.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster’s reassuring voice told him to try again. This
time they sailed along very calmly, the nose on one spot on
the horizon, seen through the glittering whirl of the propeller.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again came Armbruster’s voice:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your left wing is low, Kiwi. Pull it up slightly with your
stick.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Here was another thing for him to watch out for!</p>

<p class='c015'>At the end of a quarter of an hour they had gone a long
distance from their friends and Armbruster said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll turn the plane around and then we’ll fly back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As Kiwi felt his instructor take over the controls he let
them go, and the plane swung around in a small arc. Then
the voice came:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, Kiwi, take me home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>On the way back Kiwi practised again, only once getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>into difficulties when he got the plane into that alarming
zigzagging.</p>

<p class='c015'>They made several trips to distant points and back again.
Then Armbruster said, “We’ll land now and take a rest.”
And Kiwi confessed to himself that a rest from this concentration
would be most welcome.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they landed and taxied up to the group, several called
out to know how the pupil was making out. Kiwi was elated
to hear Armbruster say:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The boy is good. A little heavy on the controls, but
we’ll have him flying in no time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad grinned at him as he climbed from his seat and gave
him an approving pat as he came over to where Dad and
Jack were standing with Thorne.</p>

<p class='c015'>After a few minutes’ rest, and his instructor had had a
smoke, they went up again.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi practised once more on this simple business of keeping
the plane straight and on an even keel. Then Armbruster’s
voice came:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll try a turn—a turn to the right—that’s an easy one.
Now, keeping your hands and feet lightly on the controls,
you feel what they do while I make this gradual turn.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And while he was doing it, Armbruster repeated several
times:</p>

<p class='c015'>“A little bit of bank and a little bit of rudder—round she
goes. Now you try it. Pull the stick slowly over to the right
till your wings bank up; then when you have enough bank,
pull the stick back to the center and at the same time push
your rudder slightly to the right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The plane swung around dizzily.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Armbruster’s voice came through the phones: “Ah, you
used a little too much rudder. It skidded that time. Now
we’ll try another one.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This time Kiwi’s combination of bank and rudder were more
nearly right, and the plane turned in a more normal fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>They flew straight for a while and then tried another turn
to the right.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster now said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We’ll try one to the left. That’s harder because the
torque of the propeller tends to pull the plane around to the
left if you give it half a chance. So this time you need less
pressure on the left rudder than you had before on the right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s first try was not so bad. But a later one pulled the
plane around with a terrific snap and it commenced to do
things that were beyond Kiwi’s understanding. He felt Armbruster’s
hand on the controls as he rescued him from this
predicament, and the old singsong came to him now, “A little
bit of bank, a little bit of rudder—round she goes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This flight lasted much longer than the other, and before
they had landed Kiwi was beginning to make smooth and
graceful turns in either direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>During one of these later turns Kiwi was much startled as
his engine stopped in the middle of one of them, and they
seemed to be in difficulties. Then he noticed that Armbruster
had throttled back the engine, and his clear voice came to
Kiwi saying:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I just wanted you to know what would happen if the
engine suddenly stopped in the midst of one of your turns.
You must quickly put on more bank and more rudder. If you
don’t do this in time, you’ll find the plane out of control.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Try a few more turns and I’ll stop the motor in some of them
and you correct for it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>After a few more minutes of such practice they landed and
rejoined the others.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi was bubbling over with the excitement of what he had
learned and he had a thousand questions to ask both Dad and
Armbruster about his experiences. They talked it all over
and tried to tell him what he must do in each emergency.</p>

<p class='c015'>If the engine stopped unexpectedly when flying straight,
he must instinctively push the stick forward, keep the nose
down, and keep his flying speed. If it stopped during a turn,
he must rudder into the turn and keep his flying speed. Always
he must do these things instinctively when the motor failed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad and Armbruster and Jack all had stories to tell of some
spectacular experience when motors failed at crucial moments
in the air. Always when in the air the pilot’s ear is attuned to
the steady beat of the motor and he listens for its first missing
stroke.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another young flyer had joined the group and was listening
interestedly to the talk about failing motors. During a
lull in the conversation he said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Failing motors in the air are often bad enough, I grant
you, but during the war a failing motor on solid ground
turned out to be much more tragic for me.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I had just returned to my squadron from a two weeks’
stay in England and was talking to old friends and getting
accustomed to the new faces in the mess. The other pilots were
admiring the new outfit I had bought—shiny new field boots
that I had had made at that little shop in Oxford opposite
Exeter College, my whipcord breeches that were the pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of a maker on the Haymarket in London, while my tunic
came from Regent street—when an orderly came up and
handed me a slip of paper. It requested me to report to the
Major at once.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hurried over to the squadron office to my commanding
officer. He looked up when I entered and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘I know you are just back from leave and may not have
your bearings yet, but the people at the Wing Headquarters
have just given me a job which is in your special line. You
have done it so many times before that you should have no
trouble this time. We have another spy to land back of the
lines tonight, and since Gathergood is gone, you are the only
man I have who can do the job. Here on this map is the location
where you must land this fellow, and he’ll be here ready
to start with you at eleven-thirty. I’ll have the Sergeant-Major
get a good machine in readiness for you.’</p>

<p class='c015'>“There was nothing for me to do but accept this doubtful
honor. Landing spies back of the lines was no child’s play,
as you know. If caught, your uniform was no protection.
You, too, were classed as a spy and met a spy’s fate.</p>

<p class='c015'>“However, as it was then only nine-thirty I went back
to the mess and had a rubber of bridge before word came
that my spy had arrived. I hurried over to the hangar, and
as it was a warm night did not stop for a flying suit. I wrapped
a muffler around my neck, slipped into my helmet and goggles,
and climbed into the machine which the mechanics had all
ready with the motor started.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
<img src='images/i143.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'>“My passenger was already in the rear seat. I had no time
to talk to him. He gave me a jaunty little wave with his
hand and then slipped down low in the cockpit out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>way of the wind from the propeller. He looked like any
middle-aged French peasant that one might meet on the road.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Almost automatically I taxied down the field and took off.
As I came across the hangars and swung over toward the direction
of the lines, I saw that the lights in the hangars were
being switched off and knew that all would be darkness there
until it was time for my return.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The motor hummed sweetly and I began looking for landmarks.
There was no moon and the earth was a black smudge
beneath me. I crossed the lines at a great height and could
just discern the Lys River as a dim streak in the inky blackness.
There were a few star-shells coming up from the direction of
the lines, and here and there an occasional flash of artillery
fire. It was a quiet night in this particular sector. A few
miles to one side two searchlights were groping aimlessly
across the sky. All seemed serene and peaceful up aloft.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shutting off my motor so that the propeller was just
slowly turning over, I started on a long glide through the
darkness. Leaning over the side I tried to pick up the little
village that was to be my brief stopping place.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lower and lower we slipped through the still air. For a
few moments I was a little confused, but upon switching on
the light on my instrument board and consulting my map, I
located a particular road that led through a large forest. By
this time my spy was also leaning far over the side, and as
we came lower he pointed out the field we must land in.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It crossed my mind as we were getting low over the trees
that I should have opened up the engine for a few seconds
to keep it warm. A long dive such as we had just made was
apt to cool it to the point where it might not pick up again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>when I needed it. But there was no time for that now. We
were too low and the noise of it might arouse troops that
happened to be in the vicinity. Sideslipping into the field,
I straightened out just in time, and we came to a stop beside
a fringe of trees.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My passenger lost no time in getting out. He was just
clambering over the side with a parting ‘Au revoir,’ when the
motor and my heart-beats stopped at the same time.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I explained to him rapidly in a low voice that he must
turn the propeller over for me to start the motor again. He
was willing enough but unaccustomed to such work, and he was
not able to swing the propeller hard enough to do the trick.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Unhooking my belt I jumped out. I had tried twice to
turn it over when we heard the pounding thud of heavy boots
on the road. It meant that we were discovered. Evidently
soldiers in the neighborhood had heard the sing of the wires
as we glided into the field.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The spy said, ‘Be quick! Or they’ll stop you!’</p>

<p class='c015'>“Swinging frantically on the propeller I tried twice again.
But the engine refused to start. We could hear the crashing
of underbrush as they approached, and without more ado
the spy touched my arm and said, ‘Follow me!’</p>

<p class='c015'>“We darted into thick woods and then through a clearing
just as our pursuers discovered the plane. They must have
halted to examine it, and thus gave us time to cover a lot
more ground. The spy seemed familiar with the territory for
he swung into a path through the forest which led to another
road. We could hear the searching party floundering about
in the woods, but they did not seem to know which direction
we had taken.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Cautiously following the road we kept well in the shadows
and came at last to a stone farmhouse surrounded by a
wall. The spy motioned me into the darkness of a doorway
and told me to wait. He rapped cautiously at the gate with a
peculiar knock, and sometime later a man’s voice answered
him. The two men held a long consultation, and with many
gestures seemed to be pointing out a direction.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then the spy came back to me and explained briefly that
it was too dangerous to stay there—it was too close to where
the plane had landed—and that we must make our way to
a certain house about three miles farther on.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then began a nerve-wracking walk through roads and
lanes. At one place we made a wide detour to avoid going
through a town. If only I had worn my flying suit it would
have covered my uniform and made it a little more difficult
for the chance passerby to recognize me as an enemy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“At last we came within sight of the farmhouse, which
was to be my home. I was left in the shadow of a wayside
shrine while the spy went ahead to make preparations for my
reception.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“He came back in a few minutes with word that the coast
was clear. I was taken into the white kitchen and introduced
to the Belgian peasant and his wife and their son. He was
about Kiwi’s size and regarded me shyly. They talked together
for a long while, in what I took to be Flemish, apparently
trying to decide how best to conceal me. The peasant
and his wife seemed apprehensive, and the spy informed me
that they were fearful that at any moment the Germans
might come to search the house.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A peasant outfit such as the farmer wore was given me. I
discarded my uniform and field boots and slipped my feet into
heavy wooden shoes such as they wore.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Another consultation took place and a decision was finally
reached. My precious uniform was to be destroyed! And as
I sat sadly before the fireplace, my boots, breeches, tunic—one
after the other—went up in flames. For only two days
had I swanked about in them—and now they were gone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Realizing that I could speak nothing but English, which
was entirely unsuited to my present rôle, they pondered a
long time on how to overcome this difficulty. The spy, who
must have been quick-witted or he never could have succeeded
at his profession, solved it by painting the lower
half of my face with iodine and binding it up with dirty
cloths. He explained to me that if the house should be
searched and I should be questioned, I was to indicate to the
Germans that I had had an accident to my jaw and was unable
to speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There were several narrow escapes for me during the weeks
that followed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The spy left just before dawn with the comforting word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>that he would be back for me in a few days’ time and conduct
me through the lines.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The days dragged into weeks, the weeks into months,
and still I stayed on in this little farmhouse and watched our
fellows flying overhead, ceaselessly bombing an innocent
patch of woods which they probably thought contained an
ammunition dump.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Eventually I got through the lines and back home and
was able to set them right about that harmless strip of woods.
But you can easily understand why I feel so strongly about
engines failing, even on the ground.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The whole crowd laughed at the mournful face of the young
fellow who had just told the story. He looked as though he
were living over again the loss of his precious new uniform.</p>

<p class='c015'>During this recital Kiwi had been stretched out on his
back gazing up at the cloud-flecked, blue sky above him. A
pilot in a very old type of plane had been doing the most
spectacular flying just over his head during the whole story.
He was dressed in ordinary clothes, had no helmet, but flew
with a peak-cap worn backwards. Diving vertically, he
pulled out just over their heads, grinning at them as he did so.
Then he climbed straight up until he was a tiny speck in the
blue and repeated his hair-raising dive.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi marveled at this performance. Never had he seen a
plane stay in a vertical dive so long and come out of it unharmed.
And this flyer seemed to get so much satisfaction
from the maneuver and repeated it so many times that Kiwi
finally inquired who he was.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thorne told him that the pilot was one of the best of the
early American flyers, who had been well known for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>particular maneuver—and even here he was famous for it.</p>

<p class='c015'>They watched him as he at last tired of flying and came
down to rest on a solid-looking cloud above their heads. He
got out of his machine, waved to those far below, and stretched
out on the soft surface of the cloud for a nap.</p>

<p class='c015'>Back home this would have astonished Kiwi, but here he
was becoming accustomed to such things and did not consider
it at all queer. Here he was seeing all sorts of strange
things which interested him but had ceased to bewilder him.</p>

<p class='c015'>Later on he was to see workshops everywhere, in which
inventors were puzzling and studying over machines that in
the other world they had had no time to develop.</p>

<p class='c015'>One young fellow provided a great deal of quiet amusement
for the others by exhibiting a large bump on the back of his
head, which he proudly said was developing into a third eye.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thorne explained to Kiwi that here was another of those
war flyers who had been struck with the idea during the war
that an additional eye in the back of one’s head was absolutely
necessary for a flyer; that he had concentrated all his thought
upon it, and that here he felt he would surely grow one.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi now became restless and got up to stretch his legs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster rose too and said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Kiwi, let’s get on with the flying.”</p>

<p class='c015'>They strolled over to their old plane which, though somewhat
battered, still bore the number on the tail that the
Skipper remembered so well—A-4812.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now this time, Kiwi,” Armbruster said, as they resumed
their seats, “I am going to let you take the plane off the
ground. Remember, open the throttle slowly till the engine
is running smoothly; then, as the plane gathers headway,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>push the stick forward till the tail is off the ground.
As it rolls along and gathers speed, pull the stick back ever
so little. If the plane doesn’t rise, don’t force it but wait till
it seems to pick itself off the ground. Keep a sharp look ahead
and be sure and fly straight. Don’t let it swerve.” Then he
added, “All right! Let her go!”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Kiwi did as he was directed, but was warned a few seconds
later, “Don’t get the tail too high.” And as they were
speeding over the ground, “A little back pressure on the
stick,” came through the phones; and then the plane started
to rise. Kiwi’s eyes were glued on the horizon and he concentrated
on keeping the plane in a straight line until the
voice told him it was time to turn.</p>

<p class='c015'>He swung cautiously around to the right and was pleased
to hear Armbruster’s voice telling him “That’s fine!” They
practised turns to the right and turns to the left, and Armbruster
landed the plane two or three times so that Kiwi
could take it off and master that particular lesson.</p>

<p class='c015'>They finally landed, for it was getting dark.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i151.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Early the next day Armbruster said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now we’ll start on the landings. I’ll pick out a certain
spot for you to land on, and you must judge your distance
just right, throttle back the motor and glide down. Be sure
and keep the nose down so that your flying speed doesn’t
register below fifty-five miles an hour. Then, as you see the
ground approaching, pull back slightly on the stick until
you are flying on a level with the surface and just a few
inches above it. It takes a lot of practice to judge this distance
just right. You will find it’s easier if you look over
one side or the other of your cockpit—whichever is more
natural for you, do it that way. Then as you are gliding along
level and just as you feel the plane start to sink, pull the
stick back in your tummy and you’ll land all right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi took the plane off and did a few wide turns to the
right and to the left until he realized he was performing big
figure eights in the air. Then Armbruster said “There!” and
pointed to a spot upon which they should land.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi’s first try at throttling back was too soon. He felt
his instructor push the throttle forward again. But his next
try seemed right and he glided down to make a landing. He
watched, fascinated, as they drew closer to the ground,
flattened out too soon, and discovered that they were flying
level at least twelve feet off the surface.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster put the engine on. They climbed up and came
back and tried again. This time Kiwi judged his distance
better. They glided in, bounced a bit, but came to a stop with
no damage done. Again and again this was repeated until
Kiwi had learned to gauge the distance perfectly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stopping in the middle of the field, Armbruster called to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>him that now they would change places. Kiwi knew this
meant that Armbruster trusted him. He took his cushions
and moved into the rear cockpit. They took off again.</p>

<p class='c015'>He made several landings from the back seat, and then his
instructor said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“There’s a few more tricks you’ve got to learn, Kiwi. I’m
going to take you up and put you in a tail-spin and you must
get out of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Before going up again his instructor explained to him that
all his turns up to this point had been gradual ones in which
the control surfaces acted in a normal manner.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To make a sharp turn,” Armbruster further explained,
“it is necessary to increase the bank to keep the plane from
skidding out sidewise. In banking sharply, where the wings
tip up until they are vertical, the action of the elevator and
the rudder is reversed. That is, you now use your elevator
as a rudder and your rudder as an elevator.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“You must get this firmly fixed in your mind, Kiwi, for
it is very important. If you don’t, when you come to make a
vertical turn and find the nose dropping, you will instinctively
pull back the stick which, in the vertical position of the plane,
will not lift the nose. For now the elevator, acting as a rudder,
only makes your turn sharper and the nose will continue to
drop. To correct this you must lift the nose with the rudder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you sure you understand this, Kiwi? Starting to make
a turn, you put on a little bit of bank and a little bit of rudder.
As you put on more bank and the wings approach the vertical,
the stick is returned to neutral and you reverse the rudder
to keep the nose level, gradually pulling the stick back to
keep you in the turn. That’s the way to make a vertical
turn.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now if you do this wrong, and the nose drops and the
plane starts to spin toward the earth, shut off the engine,
put your stick and your rudder neutral, and immediately when
they <i>are neutral</i> press the stick forward so that you will get
into a straight dive. The plane will then be behaving normally
and can be pulled out of the dive in the usual fashion
by pulling back gently on the stick and at the same time
putting on the engine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>After this explanation they went up very high to practise
vertical turns. There were many other planes much higher
than they, and Armbruster called out:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Kiwi, do you see that little group of tiny specks to the
right? That’s a crowd who are going off on a sight-seeing
tour to some other planet. Next time they go we’ll go with
them, for it’s lots of fun. You fly on and on through space,
and the air turns blue and lavender and finally a clear, yellowish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>white as you approach the other worlds. The pull of
gravity gets less and less until you feel as light as a feather
and your plane is rocked this way and that by the whirling
eddies of air.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i155.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“But now, Kiwi, we must get on with our flying practice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Time after time Kiwi got into spins whenever Armbruster’s
instructions as to the turns were not properly followed. But
it was not long until he had become accustomed to the actions
of the plane in a tail-spin, and as they were still very high he
was able to pull them out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster now felt that he had taught Kiwi enough of
the art of flying for him to fly alone and to feel perfectly confident.
They had flown at times when the air was very bumpy,
and although at first it had frightened Kiwi somewhat, he
had soon learned to correct for the bumps automatically.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster knew that after a little practice he could teach
Kiwi to loop, which was only a matter of diving the plane
until it had attained speed enough to carry itself over the
top of the loop. He knew that Kiwi would soon learn to keep
enough rudder on to prevent him from falling out of the loop
sideways. All the other forms of acrobatics could only be
learned by practice after the fundamental things had been
thoroughly mastered.</p>

<p class='c015'>As they landed, Armbruster said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Taxi the plane in, Kiwi, and we’ll see if Dad will give
you a final test before I send you off solo.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Rejoining the group who had been watching them, Kiwi’s
face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster called out to the Skipper, “How about testing
this pupil for me, Captain?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dad shook his head as he said, “I’d rather some one else
did. Let Jack take him and give the final word.”</p>

<p class='c015'>So Jack put on his helmet and goggles, climbed into the
front seat and called back to Kiwi:</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“All right! Take me up for a ride.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi took the plane off beautifully, circled both to the right
and to the left, put the plane into a spin and recovered from it,
and amply proved to Jack that he was fit to go up alone. As
they came down Jack called to him:</p>

<p class='c015'>“You’ll do, Kiwi! Armbruster has done another good
job!”</p>

<p class='c015'>As the plane drew up to where Dad and Armbruster were
standing, Jack stopped the motor and said to Kiwi:</p>

<p class='c015'>“As soon as the air gets a little quieter I should think you
could take it up alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Here Armbruster cut in, “Don’t you think the boy does
very well for the few lessons he’s had?” And Jack agreed
with him.</p>

<p class='c015'>While other planes overhead swooped and turned against
the blue sky, they gave Kiwi his final instructions. Armbruster
told him to take-off, go to at least five hundred feet
before he made any turn, fly around until he felt perfectly
comfortable, and then to shut off his motor and make his
landing; that he ought to make at least five landings before
they could pass on him as a finished pilot.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Dad said, “And don’t forget, Kiwi—don’t fly away
and leave us, for we want you back here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m ready to fly now,” replied Kiwi, very excited. “Is
it all right, Dad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Permission was given, the engine was started, Kiwi’s
cushions were patted into place and his belt buckled.</p>

<p class='c015'>Armbruster called out, cheerily, “Don’t forget my instructions,
Kiwi, and you’ll show them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As Kiwi taxied off by himself the little group cheered him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>on. Reaching the middle of the field, he turned into the
wind and found a second in which to wave to those who
were watching him. Then, without waiting further, he
pushed forward the throttle and his first solo flight was on.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cautiously but perfectly Kiwi took the plane off the ground.
He felt a tremendous elation as he found himself alone in the
air at last, in full command of a plane. Now no one was
helping him. This bird of wood and fabric and metal was his
to command.</p>

<p class='c015'>While Kiwi had been learning to fly he had been watching
the birds, which were present in great numbers, do their
flying. Particularly he had noticed some large black birds,
not unlike crows, wheeling and circling and coming to land
amidst the gusty air close to the surface. They always swung
around into the wind when landing, and one of them—his
mind, no doubt, preoccupied by other matters—had flattened
out too high up and came down on his feet with quite a
bump, and looked as startled as Kiwi might have looked
in a similar circumstance.</p>

<p class='c015'>The little group on the ground saw Kiwi soar into the air,
and each lived again his own first solo. They forgot, for the
time being, that no harm could come to him, and hardly a
word was spoken as they watched with bated breath while
the plane circled and turned as Kiwi tried out his skill. No
one in that group could help him now. He was “on his own.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then Kiwi decided that the time had come for him to
attempt his first landing unaided. He throttled back his
motor to make the attempt. Now was the test!</p>

<p class='c015'>No strain ever quite equals that of a pupil’s first landing.
No matter who the pupil is, everyone within sight or hearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>pauses tense until it is over. The group stared, fascinated, as
young Kiwi glided down, flattened out a few inches above
the surface, and settled down to a perfect three-point landing.</p>

<p class='c015'>Kiwi had done it!</p>

<p class='c015'>A shout went up and they pounded the Skipper on the back
as he watched, almost unbelieving. Kiwi was a pilot! He
had mounted into the air alone, had mastered the air, and
had landed beautifully. He was now one of them—a flyer in
his own right, a pilot in that quiet kingdom.</p>

<p class='c015'>He made several more landings, and then as he taxied back
to the group Armbruster said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The name Kiwi doesn’t fit him now, but it will probably
stick to him forever.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i159.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>It was not long before Dad and Jack and Kiwi became
accustomed to this carefree life and made many excursions
off into the upper air in the “Dauntless.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The moon had always had a great fascination for Kiwi,
and on one flight with Armbruster and some of the others,
they soared up to it and landed on its barren surface. They
climbed in and out of the deep hollows of its dead volcanoes;
they explored its caves and the rocky beds of its dried-up
rivers.</p>

<p class='c015'>They went on numerous excursions to other planets, where
sometimes they landed and exchanged experiences with the
strange inhabitants. The flyers were looked upon as strange
adventurers, for on none of these other planets had the art
of flying been developed. But always as they floated down
like a bit of fluff to their own kingdom, they were happy to
be back among their own kind.</p>

<p class='c015'>And Kiwi began to feel that his place with them was now
assured, that he was one of them—a pilot with wings—a
Kiwi in name only.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
